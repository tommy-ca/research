# Principles Evening Command

## Purpose
End each day with systematic reflection on principle applications, learning extraction from experiences, and preparation for tomorrow's challenges using Ray Dalio's Pain + Reflection = Progress methodology.

## Command Structure
```bash
/principles-evening [reflection-depth]
```

### Optional Parameters
- `reflection-depth`: Level of analysis (quick, standard, deep)
  - `quick`: 5-10 minute focused reflection
  - `standard`: 15-20 minute comprehensive review (default)
  - `deep`: 30+ minute thorough analysis and learning extraction

## Functionality

### Core Process
1. **Principle Application Review**
   - Review morning's principle plan against actual applications
   - Assess effectiveness of principle-based decisions made today
   - Identify successful applications and contributing factors
   - Note missed opportunities for principle application

2. **Pain + Reflection = Progress Application**
   - Identify challenges, setbacks, and difficult experiences from today
   - Apply systematic reflection process to extract lessons
   - Transform pain points into learning opportunities and insights
   - Create principles or refinements based on today's experiences

3. **Decision Quality Assessment**
   - Evaluate major decisions made today using principle frameworks
   - Compare predicted outcomes with early indicators of actual results
   - Assess quality of information gathering and stakeholder input
   - Identify decision-making process improvements needed

4. **Cross-Domain Learning Integration**
   - Identify principles that worked across personal, work, and family contexts
   - Note successful transfers between life domains
   - Extract universal insights applicable to multiple areas
   - Plan cross-domain applications for discovered patterns

```python
def analyze_daily_patterns():
    """Identify recurring patterns in principle applications and outcomes"""
    
    pattern_analysis = {
        'success_patterns': identify_what_worked_well(),
        'challenge_patterns': analyze_recurring_difficulties(),
        'cross_domain_patterns': find_universal_applications(),
