# Mental Models Daily Command

## Overview
Daily mental model application system for systematic multi-disciplinary thinking enhancement, bias recognition, and decision-making improvement using Charlie Munger's latticework approach.

## Usage
```bash
/mental-models-daily [focus-area]
/mental-models-daily [decision-context]
/mental-models-daily [learning-opportunity]
```

## Parameters
- `focus-area` (optional): Specific domain to emphasize (psychology, economics, physics, biology, mathematics)
- `decision-context` (optional): Particular decision or challenge to analyze
- `learning-opportunity` (optional): Experience or situation to extract mental model insights from

## Core Functionality

### Daily Mental Model Application
- **Situation Analysis**: Identify today's decisions, challenges, and learning opportunities
- **Model Selection**: Choose relevant mental models from multiple disciplines
- **Multi-Disciplinary Analysis**: Apply psychology, economics, physics, biology, mathematics frameworks
- **Bias Check**: Systematic recognition and mitigation of cognitive biases
- **Decision Support**: Create action plans using mental model insights

### Integration Capabilities
- **PKM Enhancement**: Connect mental model applications to existing knowledge graph
- **Ray Dalio Synergy**: Combine mental models with principles-based decision-making
- **Learning Extraction**: Transform daily experiences into systematic wisdom
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring mental model effectiveness patterns

## Command Workflows

### Morning Mental Model Planning
```bash
/mental-models-daily morning

# Analyzes:
# - Today's schedule for decision opportunities
# - Relevant mental models for anticipated challenges
# - Bias risks in planned activities
# - Circle of competence considerations
# - Inversion thinking preparation
```

### Specific Decision Analysis
```bash
/mental-models-daily "negotiating salary increase with manager"

# Applies:
# - Psychology: Authority, reciprocation, social proof
# - Economics: Supply/demand, opportunity cost, game theory
# - Mathematics: Expected value, probability assessment
# - Bias checks: Overconfidence, anchoring, confirmation
# - Systematic evaluation framework
```

### Learning Integration
```bash
/mental-models-daily "reflecting on failed investment decision"

# Processes:
# - Mental models that should have been applied
# - Cognitive biases that influenced the decision
# - Cross-disciplinary insights for future improvement
# - Circle of competence boundary implications
# - Systematic learning extraction for compound wisdom
```
