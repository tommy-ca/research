# Mental Models Decision Command

## Overview
Comprehensive decision support system using Charlie Munger's latticework of mental models for superior judgment, systematic bias recognition, and multi-disciplinary analysis of complex choices.

## Usage
```bash
/mental-models-decision "decision description"
/mental-models-decision "situation context" [domain-focus]

```

## Parameters
- `decision description` (required): Clear description of the decision or problem to analyze
- `domain-focus` (optional): Specific domain emphasis (business, personal, investment, strategic)
