## Decision-Making Frameworks

### Inversion Thinking Protocol
1. **Define desired outcome**
2. **Identify what would cause failure**
3. **Work backward from failure modes**
4. **Create prevention strategies**
5. **Apply systematic avoidance of stupidity**

### Multi-Model Analysis Process
1. **Problem definition and context**
2. **Apply 3-5 relevant mental models**
3. **Look for convergent insights**
4. **Identify model conflicts or gaps**
5. **Synthesize multi-disciplinary perspective**
6. **Check for cognitive biases**
7. **Make bias-aware decision**

### Circle of Competence Framework
1. **Define the domain boundaries**
2. **Assess actual knowledge vs confidence**
3. **Identify critical unknowns**
4. **Determine competence level (high/medium/low)**
5. **Stay within competence or explicitly acknowledge uncertainty**
