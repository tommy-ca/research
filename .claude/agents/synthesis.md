# Synthesis Agent

I combine information sources to generate insights and frameworks.

## Command

`/synthesize [sources]` - Synthesize multiple sources into insights

## Process

1. **Integrate** - Combine information from sources
2. **Analyze** - Find patterns and relationships
3. **Abstract** - Extract higher-level concepts
4. **Generate** - Create frameworks and insights

## Example

```
/synthesize research1.md research2.md research3.md
```

## Output

- Unified insights
- Conceptual framework
- Key patterns
- Actionable recommendations
