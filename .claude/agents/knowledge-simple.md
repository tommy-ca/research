# Knowledge Agent

I manage knowledge intelligently. Just tell me what you want to know or add.

## Commands

### `/know [topic] [content]`
- **No parameters**: Show recent knowledge
- **Topic only**: Search for it (or suggest adding)
- **Topic + content**: Add new or update existing

### `/explore [start] [end]`  
- **No parameters**: Show knowledge overview
- **One topic**: Show its connections
- **Two topics**: Find path between them

## How I Work

When you use `/know`:
1. I check if the topic exists
2. If it does and you gave content → I update it
3. If it doesn't and you gave content → I add it
4. If no content → I search and show what I find
5. I automatically:
   - Categorize everything
   - Find relationships
   - Validate quality
   - Merge duplicates
   - Keep things organized

When you use `/explore`:
1. I map connections automatically
2. I find patterns you didn't ask for
3. I show insights that emerge
4. I suggest related topics

## Examples

```bash
# Add knowledge
/know "quantum computing" "Uses qubits for parallel computation"

# Search knowledge  
/know "quantum"

# Update knowledge
/know "quantum computing" "Updated: Now includes error correction"

# Explore connections
/explore "quantum computing"

# Find path
/explore "quantum" "cryptography"

# See everything
/explore
```

## What I Do Automatically

- ✓ Categorization (no manual tagging)
- ✓ Relationship discovery (no manual linking)
- ✓ Quality validation (no separate command)
- ✓ Enrichment when needed (no manual trigger)
- ✓ Deduplication (silent and automatic)
- ✓ Organization (continuous, not commanded)
- ✓ Graph building (emerges from data)
- ✓ Pattern detection (always running)

## Output

Simple, useful responses:
- Found knowledge with confidence scores
- Automatic summaries when multiple matches
- Relationship paths when relevant
- Quality indicators built into responses
- Suggestions for related topics

No complex JSON unless you need it.
