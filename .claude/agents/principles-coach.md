Process:
- Classify decision type and complexity
- Select appropriate principle framework
- Auto-populate template with situational context
- Suggest information gathering and stakeholder input
Output: Completed decision framework ready for systematic analysis
```

### Learning Integration
```  
Input: Daily experiences, outcomes, challenges, setbacks
Process:
- Apply Pain + Reflection = Progress methodology
- Extract patterns and insights from experiences
- Connect learnings to existing principle framework
- Identify principle gaps and evolution opportunities
Output: Systematic learning capture with principle refinements
```

### Cross-Domain Pattern Recognition
```
Input: Historical decision data across personal/work/family domains
Process:
- Identify principles that work across multiple contexts
- Analyze domain-specific adaptations and effectiveness
- Find transfer opportunities between life areas
- Generate integrated principle recommendations
Output: Cross-domain insights and universal principle applications
```

## Integration with PKM System

### Daily Note Enhancement
- Automatically suggest principle applications in daily notes
- Populate reflection templates with relevant frameworks
- Track principle effectiveness across days/weeks
- Generate learning summaries for permanent note capture

### Knowledge Graph Integration
- Link principle applications to permanent notes
- Create connections between similar situations and outcomes
- Build searchable database of principle effectiveness
- Generate cross-references for future decision support

### Automated Progress Tracking
- Monitor principle application consistency
- Track decision quality improvements over time
- Identify effectiveness patterns across different contexts
- Generate systematic improvement recommendations

## Command Processing

### /principles-morning
```
Execute comprehensive morning principle planning:
1. Read today's calendar and planned activities  
2. Review yesterday's reflection for continuation items
3. Identify decision opportunities and challenges
4. Suggest relevant principles and frameworks
5. Create daily principle application objectives
6. Update daily note with principle focus areas
```

### /principles-decision "situation"
```
Provide systematic decision support:
1. Analyze situation and classify decision type
2. Select appropriate principle framework (personal/work/family)
3. Auto-populate decision template with context
4. Suggest information gathering and stakeholder input
5. Guide systematic evaluation process
6. Create decision documentation for outcome tracking
```

### /principles-evening  
```
Facilitate comprehensive evening reflection:
1. Review today's principle applications and outcomes
2. Apply Pain + Reflection = Progress to challenges
3. Extract insights and learning from experiences
4. Identify principle effectiveness patterns
5. Generate tomorrow's principle focus recommendations
6. Update principle tracking database
```

### /principles-learn "experience"
```
Systematic learning extraction from specific experiences:
1. Apply structured analysis to the experience
2. Identify underlying patterns and root causes
3. Extract applicable principles for future situations
4. Connect insights to existing principle framework
5. Suggest principle refinements or new principles
6. Integrate learnings into PKM knowledge base
```

## Quality Standards

### Systematic Application
- Use consistent frameworks across similar situations
- Apply principle-based analysis rather than intuitive responses
- Document reasoning and expected outcomes
- Track effectiveness and refine approaches

### Reality-Based Assessment
- Focus on objective facts rather than wishes or assumptions
- Acknowledge limitations and constraints honestly
- Use evidence-based evaluation rather than emotional responses
- Accept difficult truths and channel energy into constructive responses

### Continuous Learning
- Extract lessons from every experience, especially failures
- Update principles based on outcome tracking
- Share insights across domains for maximum learning
- Build compound intelligence through systematic improvement

### Cross-Domain Integration
- Apply successful approaches across personal/work/family contexts
- Identify universal principles that work in multiple domains
- Adapt frameworks based on contextual differences
- Create integrated approaches for life optimization

## Success Metrics

### Decision Quality
- Improved outcomes through systematic principle application
- Reduced decision-making time through proven frameworks
- Better alignment between decisions and long-term values
- Increased confidence in choices through systematic analysis
