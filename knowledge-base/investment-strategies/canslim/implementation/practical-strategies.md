# CAN SLIM Practical Implementation Strategies

## The Implementation Hierarchy

### Level 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal**: Understand the mechanics before risking capital

1. **Paper Trading Setup**
   - Open a paper trading account
   - Start with $100,000 virtual capital
   - Track every decision in a journal

2. **Daily Routine** (30 minutes)
   - Pre-market: Check futures, news
   - Screen for CAN SLIM candidates
   - Review existing positions
   - End-of-day: Journal observations

3. **Weekend Analysis** (2 hours)
   - Deep dive on 5 potential candidates
   - Review week's trades and mistakes
   - Study one successful CAN SLIM stock historically

### Level 2: Systematic Execution (Months 2-3)
**Goal**: Build consistent processes

#### The 5-Step Implementation Process

```
1. SCAN → 2. RESEARCH → 3. RANK → 4. POSITION → 5. MANAGE
```

## Step 1: SCAN - Finding Candidates

### Daily Scanning Routine

```python
# Morning Scan Checklist
morning_scan = {
    "time": "30 minutes before open",
    "actions": [
        "Run primary CAN SLIM screen",
        "Check earnings calendar (next 2 weeks)",
        "Identify stocks near buy points",
        "Review institutional buying alerts",
        "Check sector rotation signals"
    ],
    "outputs": "Watch list of 10-20 stocks"
}
```

### Three-Tier Scanning Approach

#### Tier 1: Broad Universe Scan (Weekly)
```
Universe: All US stocks
Filters:
- Price > $15
- Volume > 100K
- Market Cap > $300M
Output: ~500-1000 stocks
```

#### Tier 2: CAN SLIM Filter (Daily)
```
Input: Tier 1 output
Filters:
- EPS Growth > 25%
- Near 52-week high
- RS Rating > 80
Output: ~50-100 stocks
```

#### Tier 3: Buy Point Analysis (Continuous)
```
Input: Tier 2 output
Analysis:
- Chart patterns
- Volume signatures
- Risk/Reward setup
Output: 5-10 actionable trades
```

## Step 2: RESEARCH - Due Diligence Framework

3. [Risk 3]

## Entry Strategy
- Buy Point: $___
- Stop Loss: $___ (-7%)
- Position Size: ___ shares
- Target: $___ (+20%)
```

## Step 3: RANK - Prioritization System

### Multi-Factor Ranking Model

```python
def rank_candidates(stocks):
    """
    Rank stocks by CAN SLIM strength
    """
    for stock in stocks:
        stock.score = (
            eps_score(stock) * 0.25 +      # Earnings weight
            technical_score(stock) * 0.25 + # Chart weight
            momentum_score(stock) * 0.20 +  # RS weight
            fundamental_score(stock) * 0.20 + # Quality weight
            institutional_score(stock) * 0.10  # Sponsorship weight
        )
    
    return sorted(stocks, key=lambda x: x.score, reverse=True)
```

### Prioritization Matrix

| Priority | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **A (Immediate)** | Score > 85, At buy point | Buy today |
| **B (Watch)** | Score > 75, Near buy point | Alert when ready |
| **C (Research)** | Score > 65, Forming base | Weekly review |
| **D (Monitor)** | Score > 50, Early stage | Monthly check |

## Step 4: POSITION - Entry Execution

### Position Sizing Formula

```
Position Size = Account Risk / Trade Risk

Where:
- Account Risk = Total Capital × Max Risk % (typically 1-2%)
- Trade Risk = Entry Price - Stop Loss Price

Example:
- Account: $100,000
- Max Risk: 1% = $1,000
- Entry: $50
- Stop: $46 (8% stop)
- Trade Risk: $4
- Position Size: $1,000 / $4 = 250 shares
- Position Value: 250 × $50 = $12,500 (12.5% of account)
```

### Entry Timing Rules

#### The Power of Pivot Points
```
Valid Buy Points:
1. Cup & Handle: Buy at pivot (high of handle + $0.10)
2. Flat Base: Buy at breakout above resistance
3. Double Bottom: Buy at breakout above middle peak
4. Flag: Buy at upper trendline break

Volume Requirement: 50% above average on breakout
```

#### Pyramid Entry Strategy
```
Initial Position: 50% of intended size
Add #1: +25% if stock moves up 2-3% from entry
Add #2: +25% if stock breaks secondary resistance
Never average down - only add to winners
```

### Order Types and Execution

```python
# Smart Order Execution
def place_canslim_order(symbol, shares, entry_price):
    """
    Place order with proper risk management
    """
    order = {
        'type': 'STOP_LIMIT',
        'stop_price': entry_price,
        'limit_price': entry_price * 1.005,  # 0.5% buffer
        'shares': shares,
        'time_in_force': 'DAY',
        'conditions': {
            'volume': 'above_average',
            'spread': 'max_0.5%'
        }
    }
    return order
```

## Step 5: MANAGE - Position Management

### The 3-Stage Management System

#### Stage 1: Protection (Weeks 0-2)
```
Priority: Preserve capital
- Stop loss: 7-8% below entry
- No adjustments to stop
- Exit if stock closes below 50-day MA
- Exit if market enters correction
```

#### Stage 2: Profit Building (Weeks 3-8)
```
Priority: Let winners run
- Raise stop to breakeven after 10% gain
- Trail stop at 7% below recent high
- Consider adding on strength
- Hold through normal 5-10% pullbacks
```

#### Stage 3: Profit Taking (Weeks 8+)
```
Priority: Lock in gains
- Sell 1/3 at 20% profit
- Sell 1/3 at 30% profit
- Let final 1/3 run with trailing stop
- Full exit on climax volume
```

### Risk Management Rules

#### The Eight-Week Hold Rule
```python
def evaluate_position(position, weeks_held):
    """
    O'Neil's 8-week hold evaluation
    """
    if weeks_held >= 8:
        if position.gain < 20:
            return "SELL - Underperforming"
        elif position.gain > 50:
            return "TAKE_PARTIAL - Lock profits"
        else:
            return "HOLD - On track"
    else:
        if position.gain < -7:
            return "SELL - Stop loss"
        else:
            return "HOLD - Give time"
```

#### Portfolio Heat Map
```
Maximum Risk Exposure:
- Per position: 7-8% loss = 0.5-1% portfolio impact
- Total heat: Max 6% portfolio risk at any time
- New positions: Pause if 3+ stocks hit stops in a week
```

## Real-World Implementation Examples

### Example 1: NVDA (2016-2017 Run)

**Discovery Phase** (October 2016)
- Quarterly EPS: +55% YoY
- Annual EPS: +35% CAGR
- New: AI/GPU narrative emerging
- RS Rating: 91

**Entry Execution**
- Base: 13-week cup & handle
- Buy point: $32.50
- Entry: $32.75 (11/1/2016)
- Stop: $30.25 (-7.6%)
- Position: 2% of portfolio

**Management**
- Week 4: Raised stop to breakeven at +15%
- Week 8: Sold 1/3 at $42 (+28%)
- Week 16: Sold 1/3 at $52 (+59%)
- Week 30: Stopped out remainder at $95 (+190%)

**Lessons**:
1. Strong fundamental + technical alignment
2. New technology theme (AI) drove multiple expansion
3. Pyramiding on strength multiplied gains

### Example 2: Failed Trade - GPRO (2015)

**What Went Wrong**
- Bought on "bounce" not breakout
- Ignored declining margins
- No institutional accumulation
- Fighting downtrend

**Entry**: $45 (August 2015)
**Stop Hit**: $41.50 (-7.7%)
**Actual Low**: $28 (avoided -38% loss)

**Lessons**:
1. Never compromise on criteria
2. Stop losses save portfolios
3. "Cheap" stocks often get cheaper

## Advanced Implementation Tactics

### Sector Rotation Strategy

```python
def sector_rotation_overlay():
    """
    Adjust CAN SLIM for sector trends
    """
    sector_ranks = rank_sectors_by_performance()
    
    rules = {
        'top_sectors': sectors[:3],  # Focus on top 3
        'allocation': {
            'rank_1': 0.5,  # 50% in leading sector
            'rank_2': 0.3,  # 30% in second
            'rank_3': 0.2   # 20% in third
        },
        'avoid': sectors[-3:]  # Avoid bottom 3
    }
    
    return rules
```

### Market Timing Overlay

#### The Follow-Through Day System
```
Bear to Bull Confirmation:
Day 1: Major index rallies on volume
Day 4-7: Follow-through day (1.5%+ gain on volume)
Action: Begin buying strongest CAN SLIM stocks

Bull to Bear Warning:
- Distribution days: 4-5 in 4 weeks
- Leaders breaking support
- New highs < 50
Action: Raise cash, tighten stops
```

### Options Enhancement Strategy

```python
def canslim_options_overlay(stock_position):
    """
    Use options to enhance CAN SLIM returns
    """
    strategies = {
        'protection': {
            'tool': 'Protective Put',
            'when': 'After 20% gain',
            'strike': '10% below current',
            'expiry': '3 months out'
        },
        'income': {
            'tool': 'Covered Call',
            'when': 'At resistance',
            'strike': '5-10% above current',
            'expiry': '30-45 days'
        },
        'leverage': {
            'tool': 'Call Options',
            'when': 'High conviction setup',
            'strike': 'At the money',
            'expiry': '3-6 months',
            'size': '1/4 of stock position value'
        }
    }
    return strategies
```

## Implementation Pitfalls and Solutions

### Common Mistakes and Fixes

| Mistake | Consequence | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Buying too early** | Enter before breakout | Wait for volume confirmation |
| **Position too large** | One loss devastates account | Max 10% per position |
| **Ignoring stops** | Small loss becomes disaster | Automatic stop orders |
| **Overtrading** | Death by thousand cuts | Max 3 new positions/week |
| **Confirmation bias** | Hold losers too long | Weekly review by numbers |
| **FOMO buying** | Chase extended stocks | Buy within 5% of pivot |
| **Bottom fishing** | Buy failing stocks | Only buy strength |
