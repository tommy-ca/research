# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive research knowledge base repository designed for deep research, experimentation, and knowledge management. The repository follows a structured approach to research workflow and documentation.

## Repository Structure

- `docs/`: Research documentation, methodologies, findings, and references
- `experiments/`: Experimental code, data, and analysis notebooks
- `knowledge-base/`: Structured knowledge including concepts, frameworks, and tools
- `resources/`: Supporting materials like papers, datasets, and templates

## Research Workflow

When working with research content:
1. Document research objectives in `docs/research/`
2. Place experimental code in `experiments/code/`
3. Store datasets in `experiments/data/`
4. Use `experiments/notebooks/` for Jupyter notebooks and analysis
5. Capture insights and concepts in `knowledge-base/`
6. Store reference materials in `resources/`

## Development Standards

- All experiments must be reproducible
- Use clear, descriptive naming conventions
- Document methodologies and findings comprehensively
- Reference sources and related work
- Follow established directory structure
- Use version control for tracking experimental changes

## Code and Notebook Management

- Experimental code should include clear documentation
- Notebooks should have markdown explanations for each step
- Data files should include metadata and source information
- Results should be documented with analysis and conclusions
