### NEVER (Prohibited)
1. **Skip Inbox**: Don't create notes directly in organized folders
2. **Long Notes**: Don't create notes with multiple unrelated ideas
3. **Orphan Notes**: Don't leave notes without links or categorization
4. **External Storage**: Don't store knowledge outside the vault
5. **Manual Timestamps**: Don't manually create timestamps (use automation)

### Processing Rules
1. **Inbox Zero**: Process inbox items within 48 hours

## Development Standards

### Core Development Principles

#### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD) - MANDATORY
**All agents MUST follow TDD workflow:**
```
1. RED: Write failing test/spec first
2. GREEN: Write minimal code to pass
3. REFACTOR: Improve code while tests pass
```

**TDD Rules:**
- **NEVER write code without a test/spec first**
- **Tests define the specification**
- **Each feature starts with expected behavior**
- **Validation before implementation**

**TDD Example Workflow:**
```python
# 1. Write the test FIRST (RED)
def test_pkm_capture_creates_inbox_note():
    result = pkm_capture("Test content")
    assert exists(f"vault/0-inbox/{result.filename}")
    assert result.frontmatter.type == "capture"
    
# 2. Write minimal implementation (GREEN)
def pkm_capture(content):
    # Minimal code to make test pass
    
# 3. Refactor for quality (REFACTOR)
def pkm_capture(content, source=None, tags=None):
    # Improved implementation
```

#### 2. Specs-Driven Development - PRIMARY WORKFLOW
**Every implementation MUST follow:**
1. **SPEC FIRST**: Write complete specification document
2. **REVIEW SPEC**: Validate requirements and acceptance criteria
3. **IMPLEMENT**: Build according to specification
4. **VALIDATE**: Verify against original spec

**Specification Template:**
```markdown
## Feature: [Name]
### Requirements
- FR-001: [Functional requirement]
- FR-002: [Functional requirement]
- NFR-001: [Non-functional requirement] (deferred)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given [context], When [action], Then [outcome]
- [ ] Given [context], When [action], Then [outcome]

### Test Cases
1. Test [scenario]: [expected result]
2. Test [scenario]: [expected result]
```

#### 3. FR-First Prioritization - ALWAYS
**Functional Requirements (FRs) ALWAYS come before Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):**

**PRIORITIZE (FRs):**
- ‚úÖ User-facing features
- ‚úÖ Core functionality  
- ‚úÖ Business logic
- ‚úÖ Workflows that deliver value
- ‚úÖ Integration points

**DEFER (NFRs):**
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Performance optimization (until it blocks FRs)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Scalability (until proven needed)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Security hardening (basic security only initially)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Monitoring/metrics (until system is stable)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è High availability (until production)

**Decision Framework:**
```
if feature.delivers_user_value:
    priority = "HIGH"  # Implement now
elif feature.enables_other_features:
    priority = "MEDIUM"  # Implement soon
elif feature.improves_quality and not feature.blocks_progress:
    priority = "LOW"  # Defer to later phase
```

### Research Excellence
- All research must be reproducible with complete documentation
- Multi-source validation required for critical findings
- Systematic bias detection and mitigation protocols
- Peer review validation for substantial research outputs

### Technical Standards
- Follow Claude Code's official agent patterns and configurations
- Use structured research workflows with quality gates
- Maintain comprehensive audit trails and version control
- Implement security and privacy best practices
- **MANDATORY: TDD for all new features**
- **MANDATORY: Specs-driven development flow**
- **MANDATORY: FR-first prioritization**

### Core Software Engineering Principles

#### 4. KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - ALWAYS PRIORITIZE
**Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication in PKM systems:**

**KISS Rules:**
- **Simple over clever**: Write code that anyone can understand and maintain
- **Minimal viable features**: Start with the simplest implementation that works
- **Clear function names**: Use descriptive names over comments
- **Single-purpose functions**: Each function should do one thing well
- **Avoid premature optimization**: Make it work first, optimize later only if needed

**KISS Examples:**
```python
# GOOD (KISS): Simple, clear, readable
def create_note_id():
    return datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M")

# BAD (Complex): Over-engineered for current needs
def create_note_id(format_type="timestamp", precision="minute", timezone=None, prefix=""):
    # 50 lines of complex logic...
```

**KISS Decision Framework:**
```
if solution.solves_problem and solution.is_simple:
    implement()
elif solution.solves_problem and solution.is_complex:
    simplify_first()
else:
    reject()
```

#### 5. DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) - ELIMINATE DUPLICATION
**Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous representation:**

**DRY Rules:**
- **Extract common logic**: Identify patterns and create reusable functions
- **Configuration over code**: Use data structures for repeated patterns
- **Shared constants**: Define values once, reference everywhere
- **Template patterns**: Create templates for similar structures
- **Inheritance hierarchies**: Use base classes for common behavior

**DRY Implementation Patterns:**
```python
# GOOD (DRY): Shared configuration
PARA_CATEGORIES = {
    'project': '01-projects',
    'area': '02-areas',
    'resource': '03-resources',
    'archive': '04-archives'
}

# GOOD (DRY): Common base class
class BasePkmProcessor:
    def __init__(self, vault_path: str):
        self.vault_path = Path(vault_path)
        self.create_directories()

class PkmCapture(BasePkmProcessor):
    pass

class PkmInboxProcessor(BasePkmProcessor):
    pass
```

**DRY vs Copy-Paste Decision:**
- **Copy once**: Acceptable, monitor for patterns
- **Copy twice**: Consider extracting common logic
- **Copy thrice**: MUST extract - DRY violation

#### 6. SOLID Principles - ARCHITECTURAL FOUNDATION
**Object-oriented design principles for maintainable, flexible code:**

**S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- **Rule**: Each class should have only one reason to change
- **PKM Application**: Separate capture, processing, and indexing concerns
```python
class PkmCapture:           # Only responsible for capturing content
class PkmInboxProcessor:    # Only responsible for inbox processing  
class PkmNoteIndexer:       # Only responsible for indexing notes
```

**O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- **Rule**: Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification
- **PKM Application**: Use strategy pattern for different categorization methods
```python
class BaseCategorizer:
    def categorize(self, content: str) -> str:
        raise NotImplementedError

class ParaCategorizer(BaseCategorizer):
    def categorize(self, content: str) -> str:
        # PARA method implementation

class TagBasedCategorizer(BaseCategorizer):
    def categorize(self, content: str) -> str:
        # Tag-based implementation
```

**L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- **Rule**: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
- **PKM Application**: All processors must work with same interfaces
```python
def process_content(processor: BasePkmProcessor, content: str):
    # Must work with any processor implementation
    return processor.process(content)
```

**I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- **Rule**: Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use
- **PKM Application**: Separate interfaces for different capabilities
```python
class Searchable:
    def search(self, query: str) -> List[str]: pass

class Linkable:
    def create_links(self, content: str) -> List[str]: pass

class Taggable:
    def generate_tags(self, content: str) -> List[str]: pass
```

**D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- **Rule**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- **PKM Application**: Inject dependencies rather than hard-coding
```python
class PkmSystem:
    def __init__(self, 
                 capture_service: CaptureInterface,
                 processor_service: ProcessorInterface,
                 indexer_service: IndexerInterface):
        self.capture = capture_service
        self.processor = processor_service
        self.indexer = indexer_service
```

#### Integration with TDD and Specs-Driven Development

**Principle Hierarchy:**
1. **TDD** - Test specification drives implementation
2. **Specs-driven** - Requirements define architecture
3. **FR-first** - User value before optimization
4. **KISS** - Simple solutions over clever ones
5. **DRY** - Eliminate duplication after patterns emerge
6. **SOLID** - Structure for long-term maintainability

**Decision Framework:**
```python
def design_decision(requirement, options):
    # 1. Does it pass tests? (TDD)
    if not all(test.passes for option in options):
        return "write_better_tests"
    
    # 2. Does it meet specs? (Specs-driven)
    valid_options = [opt for opt in options if opt.meets_specs]
    
    # 3. Does it deliver user value? (FR-first)
    fr_options = [opt for opt in valid_options if opt.delivers_value]
    
    # 4. Is it simple? (KISS)
    simple_options = [opt for opt in fr_options if opt.is_simple]
    
    # 5. Does it avoid duplication? (DRY)  
    dry_options = [opt for opt in simple_options if not opt.duplicates_code]
    
    # 6. Is it well-structured? (SOLID)
    return min(dry_options, key=lambda x: x.solid_violations)
```

## PKM Dogfooding Principles

### Active Implementation
- **This repository IS the PKM system** - We use it daily for all knowledge work
- **Continuous improvement** - Every friction point becomes an enhancement
- **Transparent development** - All PKM work happens in the open
- **Real-world validation** - Features tested through actual use

### Quality Metrics
- **Inbox Processing Time**: < 5 minutes per item
- **Daily Note Completion**: 100% daily
- **Link Density**: > 3 links per permanent note
- **Weekly Review Completion**: Every Sunday
- **Archive Rate**: Monthly cleanup

### Integration Points
1. **Research ‚Üí PKM**: All research outputs become permanent notes
2. **PKM ‚Üí Research**: Knowledge graph informs research directions
3. **Daily ‚Üí Projects**: Daily notes feed project updates
4. **Capture ‚Üí Synthesis**: Inbox items become synthesized knowledge

## Working with This Repository

### Development Workflow for Agents

#### When Implementing ANY Feature
1. **Write Spec First** (specs-driven development)
   ```markdown
   Feature: PKM Capture Command
   Requirements:
   - FR-001: Capture text to inbox with timestamp
   - FR-002: Add frontmatter metadata
   - NFR-001: <100ms response (DEFER)
   ```

2. **Write Test First** (TDD)
   ```python
   def test_capture_creates_file():
       # Test BEFORE implementation
   ```

3. **Implement FR First** (functional before performance)
   - Build user-facing feature
   - Defer optimization
   - Ship working code fast

4. **Validate Against Spec**
   - Check acceptance criteria
   - Run all tests
   - Document completion

### For Every Session
1. Check daily note: `vault/daily/YYYY/MM-month/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. Process any inbox items: `vault/00-inbox/`
3. Update relevant projects: `vault/02-projects/`
4. Create atomic notes for insights: `vault/permanent/notes/`
5. Commit changes with descriptive messages

### When Creating Content
1. **Always start in inbox** unless updating existing notes
2. **Use templates** from `vault/templates/`
3. **Add frontmatter** with appropriate metadata
4. **Create links** to related content
5. **Follow PARA** categorization

### When Processing Information
1. **Extract key concepts** into atomic notes
2. **Identify patterns** across notes
3. **Build connections** through links
4. **Generate summaries** at multiple levels
5. **Archive completed** items promptly
