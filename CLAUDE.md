# CLAUDE.md

This file provides persistent guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with this repository as a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system.

## Project Overview

This is a living PKM vault implementing our own specifications through dogfooding. The repository serves as both a research knowledge base AND an active PKM system using the PARA method, Zettelkasten principles, and Claude Code as the intelligence layer.

## Official Claude Code Integration

This repository includes a complete `.claude/` folder structure following [Claude Code's official documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code):

### Agent System (`.claude/agents/`)
- **deep-research.md**: Comprehensive research capabilities with multi-source validation
- **peer-review.md**: Systematic quality assurance and peer review
- **synthesis.md**: Cross-domain integration and framework development

### Configuration (`.claude/settings.json`)

- Permission management and security controls
- Environment variables and model selection

### Hook System (`.claude/hooks/`)
Automation scripts following [Claude Code Hooks](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) patterns:

- `resources/`: External references and datasets

## PKM Commands (Primary Workflow)

### Daily Operations
- `/pkm-daily` - Create/open today's daily note
- `/pkm-capture "content"` - Quick capture to inbox
- `/pkm-process` - Process inbox items with NLP
- `/pkm-review [daily|weekly|monthly]` - Review workflows

### Note Management
- `/pkm-zettel "title" "content"` - Create atomic note
- `/pkm-link "note"` - Find/suggest bidirectional links
- `/pkm-search "query"` - Search across vault
- `/pkm-tag "note"` - Auto-generate tags

### Organization
- `/pkm-organize` - Categorize notes by PARA method
- `/pkm-archive` - Move completed items to archives
- `/pkm-index` - Update permanent notes index

## Persistent PKM Rules

### ALWAYS (Non-Negotiable)
1. **Capture First, Organize Later**: Everything goes to `vault/0-inbox/` first
2. **Daily Notes**: Create/update `vault/daily/YYYY/MM-month/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for each day
3. **Atomic Notes**: One idea per note in `vault/permanent/notes/`
4. **Bidirectional Links**: Create `[[links]]` between related notes
5. **Frontmatter Required**: All notes must have YAML frontmatter with date, type, tags
6. **PARA Categorization**: Organize into Projects, Areas, Resources, or Archives
7. **Git Commits**: Auto-commit vault changes with descriptive messages

### NEVER (Prohibited)
1. **Skip Inbox**: Don't create notes directly in organized folders
2. **Long Notes**: Don't create notes with multiple unrelated ideas
3. **Orphan Notes**: Don't leave notes without links or categorization
4. **External Storage**: Don't store knowledge outside the vault
5. **Manual Timestamps**: Don't manually create timestamps (use automation)

### Processing Rules
1. **Inbox Zero**: Process inbox items within 48 hours
2. **Weekly Reviews**: Every Sunday, run `/pkm-review weekly`
3. **Project Updates**: Update project status in `vault/1-projects/` daily
4. **Archive Completed**: Move finished projects to `vault/4-archives/`
5. **Link Maintenance**: Check for broken links weekly

## PKM Workflow Automation

### On File Save
```bash
# Automatically triggered by .claude/hooks/pkm-auto-process.sh
- If in inbox ‚Üí suggest categorization
- If daily note ‚Üí extract tasks
- If zettel ‚Üí update index and links
- Always ‚Üí git commit
```

### Scheduled Tasks
- **9:00 AM Daily**: Create daily note
- **5:00 PM Daily**: Process inbox
- **Sunday 5:00 PM**: Weekly review
- **Month-end**: Archive completed items

### Auto-Processing Pipeline
1. **Capture** ‚Üí Inbox with timestamp
2. **Extract** ‚Üí Concepts, entities, topics
3. **Categorize** ‚Üí PARA method classification
4. **Link** ‚Üí Find related notes
5. **Tag** ‚Üí Generate hierarchical tags
6. **Index** ‚Üí Update search index

## Note Standards

### Frontmatter Template

## PKM Dogfooding Principles

### Active Implementation
- **This repository IS the PKM system** - We use it daily for all knowledge work
- **Continuous improvement** - Every friction point becomes an enhancement
- **Transparent development** - All PKM work happens in the open
- **Real-world validation** - Features tested through actual use

### Quality Metrics
- **Inbox Processing Time**: < 5 minutes per item
- **Daily Note Completion**: 100% daily
- **Link Density**: > 3 links per permanent note
- **Weekly Review Completion**: Every Sunday
- **Archive Rate**: Monthly cleanup

### Integration Points
1. **Research ‚Üí PKM**: All research outputs become permanent notes
2. **PKM ‚Üí Research**: Knowledge graph informs research directions
3. **Daily ‚Üí Projects**: Daily notes feed project updates
4. **Capture ‚Üí Synthesis**: Inbox items become synthesized knowledge

## Working with This Repository

### For Every Session
1. Check daily note: `vault/daily/YYYY/MM-month/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. Process any inbox items: `vault/0-inbox/`
3. Update relevant projects: `vault/1-projects/`
4. Create atomic notes for insights: `vault/permanent/notes/`
5. Commit changes with descriptive messages

### When Creating Content
1. **Always start in inbox** unless updating existing notes
2. **Use templates** from `vault/templates/`
3. **Add frontmatter** with appropriate metadata
4. **Create links** to related content
5. **Follow PARA** categorization

### When Processing Information
1. **Extract key concepts** into atomic notes
2. **Identify patterns** across notes
3. **Build connections** through links
4. **Generate summaries** at multiple levels
5. **Archive completed** items promptly
