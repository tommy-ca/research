# Zettelkasten Index

## Overview
This is the master index for the Zettelkasten (permanent notes). Each note contains one atomic idea, fully developed and self-contained.

## Structure
- Notes are identified by timestamp: `YYYYMMDDHHmm`
- Filenames include slugified title for readability
- All notes are interconnected through bidirectional links
