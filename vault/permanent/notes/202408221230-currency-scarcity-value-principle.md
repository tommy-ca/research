# Currency Scarcity Drives Value Like Trading Cards
<!-- ID: 202408221230 -->

## Core Idea
Currency value follows the same scarcity principle as Pokemon cards: limited supply + high demand = higher value.

## The Trading Card Model
When only 10 Charizard cards exist but 100 kids want them, each card becomes extremely valuable. Currency works identically.

## Four Value Drivers
1. **Scarcity**: Money supply vs. demand
2. **Usefulness**: Economic strength (what you can buy)
3. **Trust**: Government stability and credibility
4. **Liquidity**: Ease of trading for other currencies

## Why This Matters
Understanding that currency is just another tradeable asset with supply/demand dynamics removes the mystique from FX markets.

## Application
When evaluating currency strength, ask: Is this currency rare, useful, trusted, and easily traded?
