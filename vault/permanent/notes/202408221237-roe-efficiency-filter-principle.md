# ROE Above 17% Indicates Superior Capital Efficiency
<!-- ID: 202408221237 -->

## Core Metric
ROE = Net Income / Shareholder Equity
- Measures how efficiently a company converts equity into profits
- 17% threshold exceeds historical market average of ~10%

## Simple Explanation
If you gave a company $100, ROE of 17% means they'd generate $17 in profit - significantly better than savings accounts or market averages.

## Mathematical Decomposition
```
ROE = Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Financial Leverage
    = (Net Income/Sales) × (Sales/Assets) × (Assets/Equity)
```

## Quality Filter Logic
High ROE indicates the company can:
- Generate superior returns on invested capital
- Reinvest profits at attractive rates
- Compound shareholder wealth effectively

## Investment Insight
Companies with sustained high ROE (>17% for 3+ years) demonstrate consistent ability to create shareholder value, making them attractive long-term investments.

## Risk Consideration
Extremely high ROE may indicate excessive leverage (high Assets/Equity ratio) - analyze the components, not just the result.
