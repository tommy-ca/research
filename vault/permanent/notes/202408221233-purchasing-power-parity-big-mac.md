# Purchasing Power Parity Through Big Mac Economics
<!-- ID: 202408221233 -->

## Core Idea
Identical goods should cost the same worldwide when converted to common currency, revealing currency over/undervaluation.

## The Big Mac Test
- US Big Mac: $5
- European Big Mac: €4
- **Fair rate**: $5 ÷ €4 = 1.25 USD/EUR

## Valuation Signal
If actual rate is 1.50 USD/EUR:
- European Big Mac costs $6 when converted
- Euro is "overvalued" by 20%
- Theory: Euro should weaken toward 1.25

## Why It's Imperfect
Real-world factors create price differences:
- Local labor costs
- Rent variations
- Tax differences
- Import costs for ingredients

## Practical Application
PPP provides long-term currency fair value anchor, not short-term trading signals.

## Investment Insight
Persistent PPP deviations often correct over years, making it useful for strategic positioning.
