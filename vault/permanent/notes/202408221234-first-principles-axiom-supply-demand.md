# Currency Valuation Axiom: All Value Reduces to Supply-Demand
<!-- ID: 202408221234 -->

## Core Axiom
The price of anything (including currency) is determined by where supply meets demand - this is an irreducible fundamental truth.

## Universal Application
Every currency analysis, no matter how complex, ultimately reduces to:
- How much currency exists (supply)
- How much people want it (demand)
- The intersection point determines price

## Mathematical Expression
```
Exchange Rate = (Demand A / Supply A) / (Demand B / Supply B)
```

## Analytical Power
This axiom allows cutting through market noise by asking only:
1. What changes supply?
2. What changes demand?
3. Which effect dominates?

## First Principles Foundation
When Elon Musk says "boil down to fundamental truths," this supply-demand relationship is the bedrock for currency markets.
