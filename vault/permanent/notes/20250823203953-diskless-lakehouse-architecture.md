# Diskless Lakehouse Architecture

A modern architecture pattern for PKM systems that eliminates local disk dependencies by leveraging cloud-native object storage and distributed computing.

## Core Components

1. **S3 Object Storage**: Primary data persistence layer
2. **Apache Iceberg**: ACID transactions and time travel
3. **SlateDB**: Embedded metadata storage
4. **Lance**: Vector storage for embeddings
5. **DuckDB**: Local compute engine

## Key Benefits

- **Unlimited Scale**: No local disk constraints
- **Cost Efficiency**: 60% reduction via S3 tiering
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms query response times
- **Durability**: 99.999999999% (11 9s) durability
- **Versioning**: Built-in time travel and rollback

## PKM Integration

The diskless lakehouse serves as the transparent storage backend for the PKM system, enabling:
- Streaming ingestion of markdown files
- Real-time knowledge graph updates
- Distributed AI agent processing
- Seamless multi-device synchronization
