# Currency Markets Follow Physics: Price Equals Net Force
<!-- ID: 202408221235 -->

## Core Analogy
Currency markets behave like physical systems where price movement equals net force.

## Force Equation
**Currency Price = f(Net Force)**
Where Net Force = Supply Pressure - Demand Pressure

## Equilibrium States

### Static Equilibrium
```
Supply Force = Demand Force
Currency Price = Stable
```

### Dynamic Equilibrium
```
∫(Supply Force - Demand Force)dt = 0
Currency Price = Trending but stable
```

### Disequilibrium
```
Supply Force ≠ Demand Force
Currency Price = Rapidly changing
```

## Practical Application
Instead of complex analysis, simply ask:
- What forces push price up? (demand factors)
- What forces push price down? (supply factors)
- Which force set is stronger?

## Predictive Power
Like physics, knowing the forces allows predicting direction and magnitude of price movement.
