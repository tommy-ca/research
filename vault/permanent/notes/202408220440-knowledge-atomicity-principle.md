# Knowledge Atomicity Principle: Knowledge is Atomic
<!-- ID: 202408220440 -->

## Core Principle
Every piece of knowledge can be broken down to irreducible units - atomic concepts that cannot be simplified further without losing meaning.

## First Principles Foundation
This forms the foundation of effective Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) systems where complex understanding emerges from simple, well-connected atomic ideas.

## Implementation Implications
- Each note should contain one atomic concept
- Complex topics should be decomposed into constituent parts
- Atomic notes enable flexible recombination for new insights
- Reduces cognitive load through focused, digestible units

## Why This Matters
Atomicity enables the brain to build complex understanding incrementally, following natural learning patterns where mastery builds from fundamentals.
