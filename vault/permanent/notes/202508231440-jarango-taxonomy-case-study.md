# Jarango.com Taxonomy Generation Case Study

A practical demonstration of using Claude Code to analyze and reorganize Jorge Arango's personal website, showing how AI tools can support strategic content pivots and taxonomy development.

## Context

- **Site**: jarango.com (~1,300 pages)
- **Platform**: Jekyll static site generator
- **Content**: Blog posts, podcast episodes, services, books
- **Challenge**: Pivot from IA practitioners to business leaders audience
- **New Focus**: "Architecting Intelligence" - IA for AI

## Process and Results

### Initial Analysis
Claude Code correctly identified:
- Site purpose and structure
- Content types and themes
- Technical implementation (Jekyll)
- Primary focus areas

### Taxonomy Generation Results

#### Original Request - Three Approaches:
1. **Hybrid (Content Type + Domain)**
2. **Audience-Centered**
3. **Format-Based**

#### Strategic Pivot - "Business-Focused + AI Forward":
- **Architecting Intelligence**: AI/IA intersection
- **Business Strategy**: Strategic value of IA
- **Systems Leadership**: Systems thinking for executives
- **Learning Insights**: Books and thought leadership
- **Methods Frameworks**: Practical business tools
- **Reflections**: Quick insights

## Performance Metrics

- **Time**: ~3 minutes
- **Tokens**: ~64,000
- **Cost**: Fraction of graph RAG approach
- **Quality**: Actionable starting point

## Key Insights

1. **Speed Advantage**: Minutes vs weeks for traditional approach
2. **Strategic Alignment**: Successfully adapted to new business focus
3. **Practical Output**: Usable taxonomy structure (with refinement)
4. **Efficiency**: Faster and cheaper than graph RAG

## Lessons for PKM Systems

This case study validates using Claude Code for:
- Content reorganization projects
- Strategic pivots in knowledge management
- Rapid taxonomy prototyping
- Large-scale content analysis

The approach is particularly relevant for PKM systems needing to evolve their organizational structures based on changing focus or growing content volumes.
