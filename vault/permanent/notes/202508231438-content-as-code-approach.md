# Content as Code Approach

The "content as code" approach treats textual content (documentation, websites, knowledge bases) as source code that can be analyzed, versioned, and manipulated using software development tools and practices.

## Core Principle

**Code is just text** - and content is also text. This equivalence enables:
- Using code analysis tools on content
- Applying version control to content management
- Leveraging development workflows for IA tasks
- Building architectural representations of content

## Implementation with Claude Code

### Process
1. **Ingestion**: Feed content files (Markdown, text) to Claude Code
2. **Indexing**: Tool builds internal representation of content structure
3. **Analysis**: Query the entire corpus as a unified system
4. **Modification**: Optionally reorganize and restructure content

### Requirements
- Content stored as plain text files (Markdown, HTML, etc.)
- File-based organization (folders = categories)
- Static site generators ideal (Jekyll, Hugo)
- Dynamic CMS requires export step

## Benefits for Information Architecture

1. **Holistic View**: Analyze entire content repositories at once
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify themes across all content
3. **Rapid Prototyping**: Test organizational schemes quickly
4. **Version Control**: Track all structural changes
5. **Automation**: Bulk operations on content and metadata

## Practical Applications

- Website reorganization projects
- Content migration planning
- Taxonomy development
- Content audit automation
- Knowledge base structuring

This approach bridges the gap between content strategy and technical implementation, making IA work more efficient and systematic.
