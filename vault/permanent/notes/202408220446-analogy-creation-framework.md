# Analogy Creation Framework: Four-Step Process for Building Understanding
<!-- ID: 202408220446 -->

## The Four-Step Framework

### Step 1: Identify Core Function
- What does the concept fundamentally do?
- Focus on essential mechanism or process
- Strip away surface details to find essence

### Step 2: Find Familiar Parallel
- What common experience shares this function?
- Look for everyday activities or objects
- Choose something from the audience's experience

### Step 3: Map Relationships
- How do components in both systems relate?
- Create systematic correspondence between parts
- Build bridge between complex and familiar

### Step 4: Test Limits
- Where does the analogy break down?
- Identify boundaries of comparison
- Acknowledge limitations to maintain accuracy

## Implementation Template
```markdown
**Core Function**: [Concept] fundamentally [action] by [mechanism]
**Familiar Parallel**: Like [everyday experience] where [similar process]
**Component Mapping**: [Complex part] â†” [Familiar equivalent]
**Analogy Limits**: Works for [aspects] but breaks down when [limitations]
```

## Why This Works
Analogies leverage existing mental models to build new understanding, reducing cognitive load and enabling faster comprehension.

## Quality Criteria
- **Familiar**: Uses audience's existing knowledge
- **Functional**: Maps essential processes, not just surface features
- **Limited**: Acknowledges where comparison fails
- **Testable**: Can verify understanding through the analogy
