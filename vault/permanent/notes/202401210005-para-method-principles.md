# PARA Method Core Principles
<!-- ID: 202401210005 -->

## Core Idea
PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) is an organizational method that categorizes all information by actionability and time horizon, not by topic or type.

## The Four Categories

### Projects
- **Definition**: Outcomes with specific deadlines
- **Characteristic**: Has an end date
- **Examples**: Launch website, write article, complete course
- **Review frequency**: Weekly

### Areas
- **Definition**: Ongoing responsibilities to maintain
- **Characteristic**: No end date, has standards
- **Examples**: Health, finances, relationships, job role
- **Review frequency**: Monthly

### Resources
- **Definition**: Topics of ongoing interest
- **Characteristic**: For future reference
- **Examples**: Articles to read, references, inspiration
- **Review frequency**: Quarterly

### Archives
- **Definition**: Inactive items from other categories
- **Characteristic**: No longer actionable
- **Examples**: Completed projects, outdated resources
- **Review frequency**: Annually

## Key Principles

### 1. Actionability Over Subject
Traditional: Organize by topic (Physics, History, Business)
PARA: Organize by actionability (Active project? Ongoing area? Future resource?)

### 2. Just-In-Time Organization
Don't organize until necessary. Move items between categories as their actionability changes.

### 3. Progressive Disclosure
Start simple (4 folders), add subfolders only when needed. Complexity emerges from use, not planning.

### 4. Flow Between Categories
```
Resources → Projects (when activated)
Projects → Archives (when completed)
Areas → Archives (when no longer relevant)
Archives → Projects (when reactivated)
```

## Why PARA Works

1. **Mirrors Life**: Our lives have projects, responsibilities, interests, and past experiences
2. **Universal**: Works across all tools and platforms
3. **Flexible**: Items flow between categories naturally
4. **Simple**: Only 4 categories to remember
5. **Actionable**: Everything has a clear next step

## Implementation in PKM

In our vault:
- `1-projects/` - Active PKM implementation, research projects
- `2-areas/` - Knowledge management, learning, tools
- `3-resources/` - Frameworks, references, examples
- `4-archives/` - Completed projects, deprecated docs

## Common Mistakes

1. **Over-categorizing**: Creating too many subfolders upfront
2. **Topic-based filing**: Organizing by subject instead of actionability
3. **Neglecting archives**: Not moving completed items out
4. **Static organization**: Not allowing items to flow between categories

## Questions
- How granular should projects be?
- When does an area become a project?
- How often should archives be reviewed?

*PARA: Organize by actionability, not by category*
*The goal is not to organize perfectly, but to organize usefully*
