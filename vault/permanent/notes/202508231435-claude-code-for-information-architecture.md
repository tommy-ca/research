# Claude Code for Information Architecture

Claude Code, originally designed as an agentic coding assistant by Anthropic, can be repurposed for information architecture tasks by treating content (like Markdown files) as "code" to be analyzed and organized.

## Core Insight

The key insight is that **code is just text**. By feeding website content or documentation to Claude Code instead of software code, we can leverage its ability to:

1. Ingest and index entire content repositories
2. Develop internal representations of content architecture
3. Provide forest-level views of information sets
4. Generate taxonomies and organizational schemes

## Advantages Over Traditional Approaches

- **Speed**: Processes entire corpora in minutes vs hours/days
- **Efficiency**: Lower cost and energy consumption than graph RAG
- **Actionable Results**: Produces practical taxonomies rather than echoing existing structure
- **Modification Capability**: Can potentially reorganize content directly

## Use Cases for IA

1. **Understanding large unstructured information sets** during project discovery
2. **Producing draft taxonomies** for content organization
3. **Strategic content pivots** (e.g., audience or focus changes)
4. **Quick exploratory analysis** of content patterns

## Implementation Requirements

- Content must be accessible as plain text files
- Works best with static site generators (Jekyll, Hugo, etc.)
- Dynamic CMS content needs export to text first
- Backup essential before any modification attempts

This approach represents a paradigm shift in how information architects can leverage AI tools for large-scale content analysis and organization tasks.
