# Earnings Acceleration Creates Investment Momentum
<!-- ID: 202408221236 -->

## Core Principle
Companies experiencing earnings acceleration (>25% quarterly growth) tend to continue accelerating, like Newton's First Law: objects in motion stay in motion.

## Mathematical Foundation
If earnings grow at rate r, future value = current Ã— (1+r)^n
- 25% growth compounds dramatically over time
- This threshold filters out noise (inflation, GDP growth, market averages)

## Why 25% Threshold
Excludes background economic effects:
- Inflation: ~2-3%
- GDP growth: ~3-4%
- Market average: ~10%
- **Result**: Only captures exceptional performers

## Business Physics Analogy
Companies with accelerating earnings are like rockets with increasing thrust - they overcome market gravity more easily than steady-state companies.

## Investment Implication
Look for companies where "something fundamental has changed" - new products, market share gains, operational improvements driving the acceleration.
