# Dual Interface Architecture: Text + Natural Language
<!-- ID: 202408220442 -->

## Architecture Pattern
Users interact with the PKM system through two complementary interfaces:
1. **Direct Text Editing** - Markdown files in Git repository
2. **Natural Language Commands** - Claude Code command interface

## Design Rationale
Combines the precision of direct file editing with the intelligence of natural language processing for comprehensive knowledge management.

## Interface Separation
- **Text Interface**: Direct file manipulation, version control, manual organization
- **Command Interface**: Automated processing, complex operations, AI-assisted workflows

## Implementation Platform
Claude Code serves as the execution platform, bridging both interfaces through:
- File hooks for text processing workflows
- Command workflows for natural language operations
- Specialized subagents for PKM operations

## Benefits
- **Flexibility**: Choose the right tool for each task
- **Accessibility**: Natural language lowers technical barriers
- **Precision**: Direct editing maintains full control
- **Intelligence**: AI augments manual processes

## Integration Points
Both interfaces converge on the same Git repository, ensuring consistency and enabling seamless workflow transitions.
