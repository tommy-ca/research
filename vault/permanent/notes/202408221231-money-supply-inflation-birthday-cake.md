# Money Supply and Inflation: The Birthday Cake Principle
<!-- ID: 202408221231 -->

## Core Idea
Inflation happens when more money chases the same amount of goods, like having more party guests but the same size birthday cake.

## The Mathematical Relationship
- 10 guests, 1 cake = each gets 1/10 slice
- 20 guests, 1 cake = each gets 1/20 slice
- More money, same goods = each dollar buys less

## Economic Translation
- **Cake** = All goods and services in economy
- **Guests** = Total money in circulation
- **Slice size** = Purchasing power of each dollar

## Real-World Example
Government prints twice as much money but economy produces same amount of goods â†’ each dollar becomes worth half as much.

## Policy Implications
Central banks must balance money supply growth with economic output to maintain stable purchasing power.
