# Graph RAG Limitations for Information Architecture

While Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation with knowledge graphs) shows promise for some use cases, it has significant limitations for information architecture tasks, particularly taxonomy generation.

## Key Limitations

### 1. Echo Chamber Effect
- Graph RAG tends to **echo the existing structure** of the knowledge graph
- When asked for reorganization suggestions, returns current organization
- Fails to provide truly novel organizational schemes

### 2. Resource Intensity
- **Expensive**: High computational and financial costs
- **Time-consuming**: Graph building and querying takes significant time
- **Energy-intensive**: Environmental impact considerations

### 3. Mixed Results for IA Tasks
- Better for understanding content (analysis)
- Poor for suggesting new organizations (synthesis)
- Struggles with creative restructuring tasks

## Comparison with Claude Code Approach

| Aspect | Graph RAG | Claude Code |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Speed | Slow (hours/days) | Fast (minutes) |
| Cost | High | Low |
| Energy | Intensive | Efficient |
| IA Results | Echoes structure | Novel suggestions |
| Ease of Use | Complex setup | Simple CLI |

## When Graph RAG Might Still Be Useful

1. **Deep content understanding**: When you need to trace complex relationships
2. **Question answering**: Finding specific information in large corpora
3. **Knowledge validation**: Cross-referencing facts across documents

## The Fundamental Issue

Graph RAG is optimized for **retrieval** not **reorganization**. It excels at finding and connecting existing information but struggles with imaginative restructuring - exactly what information architects need most.

This limitation highlights the importance of choosing the right tool for the specific IA task at hand.
