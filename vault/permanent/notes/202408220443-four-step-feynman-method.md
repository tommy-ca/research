# Four-Step Feynman Learning Method
<!-- ID: 202408220443 -->

## The Method
The Feynman Technique consists of four iterative steps designed to achieve deep understanding:

### Step 1: Select Concept and Map Knowledge
- Create dedicated space for each concept
- Write everything you know about the topic
- Connect related concepts through links
- Track new vs. existing knowledge

### Step 2: Explain to a 12-Year-Old (ELI5)
- Use simple language, avoiding jargon
- Create concrete, relatable analogies
- Provide specific, real-world examples

### Step 3: Identify Knowledge Gaps
- Find areas where explanation breaks down
- Note unclear or missing information
- Target specific learning needs

### Step 4: Simplify and Analogize
- Refine explanations based on gaps
- Create better analogies
- Iterate until explanation is clear

## PKM Implementation
Each step maps to specific markdown-based practices:
- Dedicated files for concepts
- Tags and backlinks for connections
- ELI5 sections in notes
- Gap tracking and iterative improvement

## Why It Works
Forces active processing rather than passive consumption, revealing the difference between recognition and true understanding.
