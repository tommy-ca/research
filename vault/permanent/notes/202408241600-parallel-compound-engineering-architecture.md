# Parallel Compound Engineering Architecture

## Core Insight

Traditional compound engineering follows sequential `Plan → Execute → Review → Ship`, but **true parallel CE uses event-driven coordination** where specialized agent pools operate simultaneously with intelligent synchronization.

## Architecture Pattern: Plan → Build → Review

```
    ┌─── Planners ────┐
    │                 │
    ├─── Builders ────┼─── Coordination Layer ─── Output
    │                 │
    └─── Reviewers ───┘
```

**Core Pipeline**: Each agent pool specializes:
- **Planners**: Architecture, requirements, design decisions
- **Builders**: Implementation, coding, integration
- **Reviewers**: Quality validation, testing, approval

Agent pools operate independently but coordinate through:
1. **Event Bus**: Asynchronous message passing
2. **Shared State**: Common workspace for coordination
3. **Quality Gates**: Synchronization points requiring all streams
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Intelligent arbitration of disagreements

## Key Innovation: Smart Dependency Classification

Not all dependencies are equal. The system distinguishes:

- **Hard Blocks**: Must wait (architecture before implementation)
- **Soft Dependencies**: Better together, works without (UX mockups helpful but not required)
- **Resource Conflicts**: Can't share simultaneously (database access)
- **Feedback Loops**: Bidirectional improvement (implementation insights improve planning)

This enables **maximum parallelization while preventing failures**.

## Performance Impact

Real example: API endpoint development
- **Sequential**: 8 hours (Plan 2h → Code 3h → Review 2h → Deploy 1h)
- **Parallel**: 3 hours with **62% time reduction**

The key is **progressive coordination**: agent pools consume partial outputs from others, allowing work to proceed incrementally rather than in large handoffs.

## Claude Code Integration

Uses native Claude Code capabilities:
- **Task Tool**: Spawn parallel agent streams
- **File System**: Event coordination via Read/Write/Edit
- **Agent Ecosystem**: Reuses existing research, synthesis, knowledge agents
- **MCP Patterns**: Native coordination and state management

## Compound Learning Effect

Each parallel agent pool captures insights that improve all other pools:
- Planner insights → Better building and review criteria
- Builder discoveries → Improved planning and quality gates  
- Reviewer findings → Enhanced planning and implementation patterns

This creates **exponential improvement** where each CE workflow makes all future workflows better.

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Event-Driven Coordination**: Loose coupling between agent pools prevents blocking
2. **Progressive Dependency Resolution**: Smart analysis enables maximum parallelization
3. **Quality Gates**: Prevent premature progression while allowing parallel work
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Intelligent arbitration when pools disagree
5. **Learning Integration**: Continuous improvement through pattern capture

**Meta**: This represents a paradigm shift from sequential handoffs to **intelligent parallel coordination**. The architecture enables true compound engineering where the system gets better at engineering over time.
