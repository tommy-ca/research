# Stock Returns Follow Power Law: 80% of Gains from 4% of Stocks
<!-- ID: 202408221238 -->

## Core Principle
Stock market returns follow a power law distribution, not normal distribution - extreme winners drive most portfolio returns.

## Mathematical Reality
```python
# In 1000 stock universe:
top_1pct = 10 stocks    # 300% average return
next_4pct = 40 stocks   # 100% average return  
next_15pct = 150 stocks # 30% average return
bottom_80pct = 800 stocks # -5% average return
```

## Nested 80/20 Rule
- 80% of market returns from 20% of stocks
- Within that 20%, 80% of returns from top 20% (4% of total)
- **Conclusion**: 4% of stocks drive 64% of market returns

## Investment Implication
Traditional diversification misses the point - better to own concentrated positions in the 4% than spread across mediocre performers.

## Why This Matters
Explains why CAN SLIM works: system designed to identify the 4% of extreme winners early in their cycle.

## Universal Application
Power laws appear in technology (network effects), business (revenue distribution), and biology (population dynamics).
