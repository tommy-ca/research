# Executive Summary

A comprehensive Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system where all central workflows are implemented on top of Claude Code as the execution platform. Users interact through a dual interface - directly editing markdown texts and using natural language commands. Claude Code provides the implementation layer through specialized subagents, commands, and hooks that manage both PKM operations and lakehouse interactions. The system maintains PKM principles at the business layer while leveraging enterprise-grade storage transparently.
