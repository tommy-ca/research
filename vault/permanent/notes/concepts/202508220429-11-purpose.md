# 1.1 Purpose

The Markdown-Based Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) System is designed to provide a comprehensive, extensible, and intelligent platform for capturing, processing, organizing, and synthesizing personal knowledge using a modern diskless lakehouse architecture. The system combines markdown files and Git for source control with Apache Iceberg for ACID transactions, SlateDB for metadata, Lance for vectors, and S3 for unified storage, all powered by AI agents and streaming processing.
