# ELI5 Explanation Requirement: Every Concept Needs Simple Version
<!-- ID: 202408220441 -->

## Core Requirement
Every complex concept must have an ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5) representation as part of the knowledge system.

## Feynman Integration Principle
This implements Feynman's teaching test: if you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it well enough.

## Progressive Complexity Layers
Knowledge should be structured in layers:
1. ELI5 version (accessible to anyone)
2. Intermediate explanation (domain context)
3. Advanced technical detail (expert level)

## Knowledge Gap Detection
Failed explanation attempts reveal gaps in understanding, triggering research and learning cycles.

## Implementation Strategy
- Create simplified versions alongside technical documentation
- Use analogies and everyday examples
- Test explanations with non-experts
- Iterate based on comprehension feedback

## Why This Works
Simple explanations force deep understanding and create accessible entry points for knowledge sharing and teaching.
