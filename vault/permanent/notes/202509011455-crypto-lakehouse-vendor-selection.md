## Decision Framework Matrix

Choose crypto lakehouse solutions based on **organizational context**, **technical requirements**, and **strategic priorities**.

## Primary Decision Factors

### 1. Organizational Maturity
```
Startup/SMB → Web3-Native Solutions (Hyperline, SQD.AI)
Mid-Market → Traditional Adapted (Databricks, Snowflake)  
Enterprise → Custom or Enterprise Platforms (TRM approach)
```

### 2. Use Case Priority
```
Compliance-First → Traditional Vendors (Chainalysis, Elliptic)
Analytics-First → Lakehouse Platforms (Hyperline, Databricks)
Cost-Optimized → Decentralized Solutions (SQD.AI)
Performance-Critical → Custom Implementation (TRM style)
```

### 3. Technical Constraints  
```
Multi-Chain → Broad ecosystem support required
Real-Time → Sub-second latency requirements
Scale → Petabyte-scale data processing
Integration → Existing toolchain compatibility
```

## Selection Decision Tree

```
1. What's your primary use case?
   ├─ Compliance/Risk → Traditional (Chainalysis/Elliptic)
   ├─ Analytics/Research → Platform approach
   └─ Development/Integration → Web3-native

2. What's your organization size?
   ├─ < 50 people → Hyperline or SQD.AI
   ├─ 50-500 people → Databricks or traditional
   └─ > 500 people → Custom or enterprise

3. What's your blockchain focus?
   ├─ Single chain → Any solution works
   ├─ Multi-chain → Broad ecosystem support needed
   └─ All chains → SQD.AI or custom

4. What are your performance needs?
   ├─ Real-time critical → StarRocks-based solutions
   ├─ Batch acceptable → Any warehouse solution
   └─ Sub-second required → Custom optimization

5. What's your budget model?
   ├─ Capital constrained → SQD.AI or open source
   ├─ Operational spend → SaaS solutions
   └─ Investment available → Custom implementation
```

## Technical Evaluation Criteria

### Performance Requirements (Weight: 30%)
- **Query latency**: < 1s for user-facing, < 10s for analytics
- **Throughput**: Concurrent user support  
- **Data freshness**: Real-time vs batch acceptable
- **Scalability**: Growth trajectory handling

### Integration Requirements (Weight: 25%)
- **Existing stack**: BI tools, databases, applications
- **API availability**: REST, SQL, streaming interfaces
- **Data formats**: Parquet, JSON, custom formats
- **Security**: SSO, RBAC, encryption, compliance

### Operational Requirements (Weight: 25%)
- **Maintenance overhead**: Fully managed vs self-hosted
- **Monitoring**: Observability and alerting  
- **Backup/recovery**: Data protection capabilities
- **SLA guarantees**: Uptime and support commitments

### Cost Model (Weight: 20%)
- **Pricing transparency**: Clear cost structure
- **Scaling economics**: Cost per GB/query/user
- **Hidden costs**: Professional services, training
- **ROI timeline**: Time to value realization

## Risk Assessment Matrix

### Low Risk Choices
- **Databricks**: Proven enterprise platform
- **Traditional vendors**: Chainalysis, Elliptic for compliance

### Medium Risk Choices  
- **Hyperline**: New but funded, Web3 focus
- **Custom implementation**: High complexity but controllable

### Higher Risk Choices
- **SQD.AI**: Token model complexity, governance questions
- **Other emerging platforms**: Limited track record

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (1-2 months)
- **Goal**: Validate architecture with real data
- **Approach**: Small dataset, key use cases  
- **Success metrics**: Performance, ease of use, cost

### Phase 2: Pilot Deployment (3-6 months)
- **Goal**: Production-ready implementation
- **Approach**: Full dataset, comprehensive testing
- **Success metrics**: SLA compliance, user adoption

### Phase 3: Scale & Optimize (6-12 months)
- **Goal**: Enterprise-wide deployment
- **Approach**: Performance tuning, cost optimization
- **Success metrics**: ROI achievement, business impact

## Red Flags to Avoid

1. **Vendor lock-in without clear migration path**
2. **Pricing models that don't scale with usage**
3. **Limited blockchain ecosystem support**  
4. **Poor documentation or developer experience**
5. **Lack of compliance or security features**
6. **No clear roadmap or funding concerns**
7. **Inadequate performance for real-time use cases**

## Future-Proofing Considerations
