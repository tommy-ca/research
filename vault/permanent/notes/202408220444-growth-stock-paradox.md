# Growth Stock Paradox: Why Expensive Stocks Get More Expensive
<!-- ID: 202408220444 -->

## The Central Question
Why do some expensive stocks keep getting more expensive while cheap stocks get cheaper?

## Traditional Finance vs. Reality

### Traditional Finance Theory Expects:
- **Efficient Market Hypothesis**: All information is priced in
- **Mean Reversion**: Outliers return to average
- **Value Premium**: Cheap stocks outperform

### CAN SLIM Reality Observes:
- **Market Inefficiency**: Markets are inefficient in short-medium term
- **Momentum Persistence**: Trends last longer than theory predicts  
- **Growth Compounding**: Returns exceed rational expectations

## The Resolution
The paradox exists because traditional finance theory assumes rational, efficient markets, while reality shows behavioral biases and information processing delays create sustained momentum periods.

## Investment Implications
- Growth stocks with strong fundamentals can sustain "expensive" valuations
- Momentum effects enable extended runs beyond theoretical fair value
- Early identification of growth leaders provides asymmetric returns

## Why This Matters
Understanding this paradox is key to CAN SLIM success - it explains why the system focuses on growth acceleration rather than traditional value metrics.
