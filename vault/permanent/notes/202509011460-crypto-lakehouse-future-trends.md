- Technical impact: Multi-region lakehouse deployments
- Solution: Federated analytics across jurisdictions

## Business Model Evolution

### 1. Platform Economics
**Network effects in data platforms**
- Pattern: More users → better data → more users
- Example: Dune Analytics community model
- Prediction: Data networks become winner-take-most markets

**Data monetization models**
- Trend: Organizations monetize proprietary blockchain insights
- Mechanism: API access, data marketplace, analytics services
- Timeline: Mature by 2026

### 2. Industry Vertical Specialization
**Domain-specific lakehouses emerge**
- **DeFi Analytics**: Protocol-specific optimizations
- **NFT Markets**: Metadata and provenance focus
- **Gaming/Metaverse**: Virtual asset analytics
- **Supply Chain**: Cross-chain tracking
