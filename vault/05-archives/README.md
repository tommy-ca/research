---# ðŸ“¥ Inbox - Capture & Triage

## Purpose
The inbox is the entry point for all new information. Everything starts here before being processed and organized into the appropriate PARA category.

## Workflow

### 1. Capture (Everything Goes Here First)
- Quick thoughts and ideas â†’ `quick-capture/`
- Web articles and bookmarks â†’ `web-clips/`
- Voice recordings and transcriptions â†’ `voice-notes/`

### 2. Process (Daily/Weekly)
Use Claude Code to process inbox items:
```bash
/pkm-process inbox
```

### 3. Categorize (PARA Method)
- **Project**: Has a deadline and specific outcome â†’ Move to `1-projects/`
- **Area**: Ongoing responsibility, no end date â†’ Move to `2-areas/`
- **Resource**: Reference material for future â†’ Move to `3-resources/`
- **Archive**: No longer active â†’ Move to `4-archives/`
