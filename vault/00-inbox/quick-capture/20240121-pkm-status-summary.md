# PKM Implementation Status Summary

## ✅ Completed Today

### 1. Vault Structure Established
- PARA method folders (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
- Daily notes system with template
- Zettelkasten permanent notes structure
- Inbox capture workflow
- Templates for all note types

### 2. CLAUDE.md Enhanced with Persistent Rules
- **ALWAYS rules**: Capture first, daily notes, atomic notes, links
- **NEVER rules**: Skip inbox, long notes, orphans, external storage
- **Processing rules**: Inbox zero, weekly reviews, project updates
- **PKM commands**: Daily, capture, process, review, zettel, link, search
- **Automation**: File save triggers, scheduled tasks, processing pipeline
- **Dogfooding principles**: Active use, continuous improvement, metrics

### 3. Documentation Created
- DOGFOODING-PLAN.md - Complete implementation strategy
- Week 2 Schedule - Detailed migration plan
- Project tracking in vault/1-projects/pkm-system/
- First daily note (2024-01-21)
- First zettelkasten note on dogfooding

### 4. Configuration & Automation
- .pkm/config.yaml - System configuration
- .claude/hooks/pkm-auto-process.sh - Automation hooks
- .claude/commands/pkm-capture.md - Command documentation
- Git integration for auto-commits
