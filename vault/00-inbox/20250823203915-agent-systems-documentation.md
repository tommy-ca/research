# Agent Systems Documentation - Ingestion

## Summary
Collection of agent system documentation including specifications, protocols, implementation guides, and quality assurance frameworks.

## Key Components to Process
- [ ] Agent Architecture Overview
- [ ] Agent Specifications (YAML + MD)
- [ ] Implementation Protocols
- [ ] Quality Assurance Standards
- [ ] Workflow Definitions
- [ ] Technical Documentation
- [ ] Compliance Requirements

## Agent Types Documented
1. **Research Agents**
   - Deep Research Agent
   - Peer Review Agent
   - Synthesis Agent
   
2. **PKM Agents**
   - PKM Ingestion Agent
   - PKM Processor Agent
   - PKM Synthesizer Agent
   - PKM Feynman Agent

## Processing Priority
1. Extract agent-specific atomic notes
2. Create agent capability matrix
3. Link to PKM system architecture
4. Document integration patterns
5. Update agent registry
