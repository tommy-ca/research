# 2025-08-23 Daily Note

## PKM Documentation Reingestion Completed

### Summary
Successfully reingested architecture and agent documentation into the PKM vault following proper pipelines.

### Actions Taken
1. ✅ Analyzed existing documentation structure
2. ✅ Cleaned up 3 duplicate research documentation files
3. ✅ Created inbox entries for architecture documentation
4. ✅ Extracted 5 new atomic notes:
   - Diskless Lakehouse Architecture
   - Dual Interface for PKM Systems
   - Specification-Driven Development
   - Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns
   - PKM Architecture Documentation Index
5. ✅ Created bidirectional links between related concepts
6. ✅ Updated existing notes with new connections

### Key Insights
- The PKM system architecture uses a modern diskless lakehouse approach
- Dual interface pattern (text + natural language) is central to usability
- Specification-driven development ensures quality across agent implementations
- Multi-agent coordination enables complex research workflows

### Documentation Status
- **Processed**: Core architecture concepts extracted into atomic notes
- **Remaining**: Detailed agent specifications and implementation guides
- **Next Steps**: Process individual agent documentation through Feynman simplification

### Links Created
- Connected new architecture notes to existing PKM dogfooding principles
- Linked dual interface implementations (original and extended)
- Created central architecture index for navigation

### Repository Changes
- Removed duplicate files from resources and permanent notes
- Added new atomic notes with proper frontmatter
- Updated link references in existing notes
- Maintained git history with descriptive commits

## Other Activities
- Continued work on PKM retrieval agent feature branch
- Vault maintenance and organization
