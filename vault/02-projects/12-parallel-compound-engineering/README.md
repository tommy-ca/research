# Parallel Compound Engineering Implementation

**Project Goal**: Implement parallel compound engineering pipelines for Claude Code with deep PKM system integration.

## Project Overview

This project implements true parallel compound engineering workflows that coordinate multiple concurrent streams (planning, execution, review) through intelligent event-driven coordination while maintaining deep integration with the PKM system for compound learning effects.

### Key Innovations

1. **Claude Code Native Architecture**: Uses Task tool for true parallel execution with file-based event coordination
2. **MCP Integration**: Native MCP patterns for agent coordination and state management  
3. **PKM Deep Integration**: Real-time knowledge capture and historical pattern retrieval
4. **Intelligent Coordination**: Smart dependency resolution and conflict management

## Architecture Components

### Core Pipeline: Plan → Build → Review

- **Planners Pool**: Architecture, requirements, design (`research` + `synthesis` agents)
- **Builders Pool**: Implementation, coding, integration (`knowledge` + `pkm-processor` agents)  
- **Reviewers Pool**: Quality validation, testing, approval (`synthesis` + `pkm-feynman` agents)
- **Coordination Layer**: Orchestration + conflict resolution

### MCP-Native Agents
- `compound-parallel`: Master orchestrator for Plan → Build → Review pipeline
- `ce-planners`, `ce-builders`, `ce-reviewers`: Specialized agent pools
- `ce-coordinator`: Inter-pool coordination and conflict resolution
- `ce-state-manager`: Shared state management across pools

### PKM Integration Points
- Real-time knowledge capture from all agent pools (planners, builders, reviewers)
- Historical pattern retrieval for informed decision making
- Specialized PKM processors for CE workflow optimization
- Cross-project learning and improvement through pipeline analysis

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement (1-2 weeks)
- Enhanced workspace management
- Event system foundation
- State management
- PKM integration points

### Phase 2: Parallel Agent Pool Implementation (2-3 weeks)  
- Agent pool architecture (planners, builders, reviewers)
- Parallel orchestrator for Plan → Build → Review pipeline
- Parallel commands (/ce-parallel-plan, /ce-parallel-build, /ce-parallel-review)
- Dependency management across agent pools

### Phase 3: Advanced Coordination (2-3 weeks)
- Conflict resolution engine
- Quality gate system
- Progressive coordination
- Performance optimization

### Phase 4: PKM Deep Integration (1-2 weeks)
- PKM CE processor
- CE pattern learning
- Predictive CE capabilities
- Cross-project learning

### Phase 5: Production Hardening (1 week)
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation
- Performance monitoring
- Error recovery

## Expected Benefits

- **60-70% time reduction** in CE workflows through parallelization
- **Compound learning** where each CE project improves future ones
- **Intelligent coordination** preventing conflicts and optimizing dependencies
- **Self-improving system** through deep PKM integration

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics

- Event coordination latency
- Dependency resolution accuracy
- Quality gate effectiveness

### Learning Metrics  
- Knowledge capture rate from CE workflows
