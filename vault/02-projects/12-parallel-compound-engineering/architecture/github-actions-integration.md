# GitHub Actions Integration for Parallel Compound Engineering

## Integration Overview

GitHub Actions integration enables **automated parallel compound engineering workflows** triggered by repository events, providing CI/CD pipeline automation for Plan → Build → Review cycles.

## Architecture: CI/CD + Parallel CE

```yaml
GitHub Repository Events (Issues, PRs, Comments)
    ↓
GitHub Actions Workflow Triggers
    ↓
┌─── Planners Pool ────┐    ┌─── GitHub Integration ────┐
│ @claude plan feature │────│ PR Creation & Updates     │
├─── Builders Pool ────┤    │ Issue Comments & Status   │  
│ @claude implement    │────│ Branch Management         │
├─── Reviewers Pool ───┤    │ Automated Testing         │
│ @claude review code  │────│ Quality Gates             │
└─────────────────────┘    └───────────────────────────┘
    ↓
Automated Deployment Pipeline
```

## Key Integration Capabilities

### 1. Event-Driven Triggers
- **Issue Comments**: `@claude ce-parallel-plan "feature description"`
- **PR Events**: Automatic review and improvement suggestions
- **Workflow Dispatch**: Manual trigger for complex feature development
- **Schedule Events**: Periodic code quality improvements

### 2. Parallel Agent Pool Execution
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    pool: [planners, builders, reviewers]
    
# Each pool runs independently with:
- Specialized Claude Code agents
- Pool-specific inputs and outputs  
- Cross-pool artifact sharing
- Quality gate validation
```

### 3. Progressive Pipeline Integration
```yaml
# Sequential Phase Execution with Parallel Agents
Phase 1: Planning (parallel planners)
  ↓ (plan_ready event)
Phase 2: Building (parallel builders) 
  ↓ (build_ready event)
Phase 3: Review (parallel reviewers)
  ↓ (review_complete event)
Phase 4: Deploy (automated deployment)
```

## Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Feature Development Workflow
```yaml
name: Parallel CE Feature Development

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
    
jobs:
  parse-command:
    if: contains(github.event.comment.body, '@claude ce-parallel')
    outputs:
      command: ${{ steps.parse.outputs.command }}
      feature: ${{ steps.parse.outputs.feature }}
      
  planners-pool:
    needs: parse-command
    strategy:
      matrix:
        role: [architect, requirements, dependencies]
    steps:
      - name: Parallel Planning
        uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          agent: "ce-planners-pool"
          role: ${{ matrix.role }}
          feature: ${{ needs.parse-command.outputs.feature }}
```

### Pattern 2: Quality Assurance Workflow  
```yaml
name: Parallel CE Quality Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
    
jobs:
  reviewers-pool:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        dimension: [quality, security, performance, documentation]
    steps:
      - name: Parallel Quality Review
        uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          agent: "ce-reviewers-pool" 
          dimension: ${{ matrix.dimension }}
          pr-diff: ${{ github.event.pull_request.diff_url }}
```

### Pattern 3: Continuous Integration Pipeline

  builders-pool:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        task: [implementation, testing, integration, documentation]
    steps:
      - name: Parallel Building & Testing

        # Security vulnerabilities addressed
        # Performance requirements met
        # Documentation updated
        
    - name: Deploy Authorization
      if: success()
      uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1

    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    event-type: pool-ready
    client-payload: |
      {
        "pool": "builders",
        "artifacts": "${{ steps.planning.outputs.artifacts-url }}"
      }
```

### 3. Status Reporting

    script: |
      github.rest.repos.createCommitStatus({
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        repo: context.repo.repo,
        sha: context.sha,
        state: 'success',
        description: 'Parallel CE Planning Complete',
        context: 'ce-planners-pool'
      });
```

## Environment Configuration

### Repository Setup
```yaml

- name: Configure Claude Code
  env:
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    CLAUDE_MODEL: claude-3-opus-20240229
    
- name: Setup Parallel CE Workspace
  run: |
    mkdir -p .ce-workspace/{events,state,progress,artifacts}

```

### 3. Resource Management
```yaml
jobs:
  planners-pool:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest-4-cores  # High CPU for planning
    timeout-minutes: 30
    
  builders-pool:
