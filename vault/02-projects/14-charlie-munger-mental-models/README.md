# Charlie Munger Mental Models System

## Project Overview

Systematic integration of Charlie Munger's "Elementary, Worldly Wisdom" mental models framework into our PKM system, creating a multi-disciplinary decision-making and thinking enhancement system with compound intelligence development.

## Core Mission

Transform Charlie Munger's latticework of mental models into practical, implementable PKM workflows for:
- **Multi-Disciplinary Thinking**: Psychology, economics, physics, biology, mathematics integration
- **Superior Decision-Making**: Systematic bias reduction and judgment improvement
- **Compound Learning**: Cross-domain pattern recognition and wisdom accumulation
- **Systematic Problem-Solving**: Multi-model analysis and synthesis capabilities

## Key Components

### 1. Mental Models Framework
- **Latticework Architecture**: 80-90 key mental models interconnected for worldly wisdom
- **Multi-Disciplinary Integration**: Cross-domain knowledge synthesis and application
- **Systematic Bias Recognition**: 25+ cognitive bias identification and mitigation
- **Inversion Thinking**: "Tell me where I'm going to die so I'll never go there"

### 2. Implementation Systems
- **Mental Model Database**: Organized taxonomy with definitions, applications, examples
- **Decision-Making Templates**: Multi-model analysis frameworks and checklists
- **Bias Detection System**: Automated recognition and mitigation prompts
- **Circle of Competence Tracker**: Knowledge boundary definition and expansion

### 3. PKM Integration
- **Cross-Disciplinary Connections**: Automated insight synthesis across knowledge domains
- **Pattern Recognition Engine**: Mental model interaction and reinforcement identification
- **Decision Documentation**: Systematic capture and analysis of mental model applications
- **Compound Intelligence**: Learning accumulation that improves thinking capability over time
