# Cognitive Biases Framework - Charlie Munger's 25+ Standard Causes of Human Misjudgment

## Overview

Systematic framework for recognizing and mitigating cognitive biases based on Charlie Munger's comprehensive analysis of human psychological tendencies that lead to poor judgment and decision-making errors.

## Core Principle

**"The human mind is a lot like the human egg, and the human egg has a shut-off device. When one sperm gets in, it shuts down so the next one can't get in."** - Understanding how our minds systematically fool us is essential for better thinking.

## The 25+ Standard Causes of Human Misjudgment

### 1. Reward and Punishment Super-Response Tendency
**Description**: Extreme response to incentive structures, often overriding other considerations
**Manifestations**:
- "Show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome"
- Gaming metrics when compensation is tied to specific measures
- Neglecting unmeasured but important factors

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Always ask: "What are the incentives here?"
- Consider how incentives might distort behavior
- Design systems that align incentives with desired outcomes

### 2. Liking/Loving Tendency
**Description**: Tendency to favor people we like, distorting objective judgment
**Manifestations**:
- Hiring friends over more qualified candidates
- Believing information from liked sources without proper scrutiny
- Excusing poor performance from people we like

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Separate person evaluation from idea evaluation
- Use blind evaluation processes when possible
- Seek input from neutral parties

### 3. Disliking/Hating Tendency
**Description**: Tendency to reject ideas from disliked sources, regardless of merit
**Manifestations**:
- Dismissing good ideas because of their source
- Assuming worst motives from disliked individuals
- Systematic undervaluation of contributions from disliked parties

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Focus on idea merit independent of source
- Use devil's advocate processes

**Manifestations**:
- Making decisions too quickly to eliminate uncertainty
- Preferring any decision over no decision
- Overconfidence in limited information

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Embrace productive uncertainty

- Focus on opportunity cost rather than sunk cost
- Regular systematic review of major commitments

### 6. Curiosity Tendency
**Description**: Natural drive to understand and explore, which can be both helpful and problematic
**Manifestations**:
- Beneficial: Drives learning and discovery
- Problematic: Can lead to distraction from priorities
- Information seeking without clear purpose

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Channel curiosity toward high-value learning
- Set boundaries around exploratory activities
- Use curiosity to challenge assumptions systematically

### 7. Kantian Fairness Tendency
**Description**: Expectation that others will behave as we would, and frustration when they don't
**Manifestations**:
- Assuming others share our values and priorities
- Frustration with different approaches to fairness
- Difficulty understanding different cultural or personal perspectives

**Mitigation Strategies**:

**Manifestations**:
- Making poor decisions out of obligation to return favors
- Being manipulated through small gifts or favors
- Feeling guilty about not reciprocating immediately

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Extreme organizational dysfunctions

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Look for multiple bias interactions
- Systematic bias checking across categories
- External perspective when multiple biases may be operating

## Systematic Bias Recognition Framework

### Daily Bias Checking Process
1. **Before important decisions**: Quick scan for likely biases
2. **During decision-making**: Monitor for bias influence in real-time
3. **After decisions**: Review for missed biases and learn for next time

### Decision-Specific Bias Analysis
1. **Identify high-risk biases** for the specific situation
2. **Apply systematic checks** for each identified bias
3. **Seek perspectives** that counter likely biases
4. **Document reasoning** to enable later bias analysis

### Organizational Bias Mitigation
1. **Design processes** that reduce systematic bias influence
2. **Create accountability** for bias-aware decision-making
3. **Build diverse teams** to counteract individual biases
4. **Establish decision audit** systems for learning

**Application Note**: This framework should be used systematically rather than occasionally - the goal is to develop automatic bias recognition and mitigation as a core thinking skill, enabling compound improvement in decision-making quality over time.
