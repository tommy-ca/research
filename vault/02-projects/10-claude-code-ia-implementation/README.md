# Claude Code IA Implementation Project

Implement Jorge Arango's approach to using Claude Code for information architecture within our PKM system.

## Project Overview

### Goal
Enhance our PKM system with Claude Code's capability to analyze and reorganize content at the architectural level, improving categorization, taxonomy generation, and knowledge synthesis.

### Expected Outcomes
1. Automated vault analysis and taxonomy generation
2. Improved inbox processing with AI-suggested categorization
3. Enhanced knowledge graph through automated link discovery
4. Dynamic reorganization capabilities

## Key Milestones

### Phase 1: Research & Experimentation (Week 1-2)
- [x] Ingest and analyze Arango's article
- [ ] Test Claude Code on vault subset
- [ ] Document effective prompts
- [ ] Evaluate performance metrics

### Phase 2: Integration Design (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Design PKM command interfaces
- [ ] Create integration architecture
- [ ] Plan automation workflows
- [ ] Define quality control measures

### Phase 3: Implementation (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Implement `/pkm-analyze-vault` command
- [ ] Create categorization suggestion engine
- [ ] Build link discovery system
- [ ] Add taxonomy generation

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Test with real vault content
- [ ] Measure processing improvements
- [ ] Refine based on usage
- [ ] Document best practices

## Technical Approach

### Core Components
1. **Claude Code Interface**: Wrapper for vault analysis
2. **Taxonomy Generator**: Multi-scheme generation
3. **Categorization Engine**: PARA method integration
4. **Link Discovery**: Bidirectional link suggestions

### Integration Points
- PKM capture workflow
- Inbox processing pipeline
- Weekly review automation
- Knowledge synthesis commands

## Success Metrics

- **Processing Speed**: Reduce inbox processing to <1 min/item
- **Categorization Accuracy**: >80% correct PARA placement
- **Link Discovery**: Find 3+ relevant links per note
- **Taxonomy Quality**: Actionable schemes requiring <20% refinement
