# Core Personal Life Principles

### Application Framework

### Decision Template
```
Situation: [Current reality without interpretation]
Desired State: [What you want to achieve]
Gap Analysis: [Honest assessment of obstacles]
Action Plan: [Reality-based steps forward]
```

### Examples
- **Career**: Acknowledge skill gaps honestly rather than hoping they'll be overlooked

## Principle 2: Pain + Reflection = Progress

### Definition
Every painful experience contains valuable lessons. Systematic reflection transforms pain into growth.

```
1. What happened? (Objective facts)
2. What was my role? (Personal responsibility)
3. What patterns do I notice? (Recurring themes)
4. What principle can I create? (Future guidance)
5. How will I test this principle? (Implementation plan)
```

### Examples

- **Solution Orientation**: Focus energy on learning and solutions
- **Pattern Analysis**: Look for underlying causes rather than surface issues

```
