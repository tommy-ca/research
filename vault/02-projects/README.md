# Active Projects Index

This directory contains all active projects following the PARA method organization.

## Projects Naming Convention

- Format: `NN-kebab-slug` (two digits + kebab case), e.g., `01-pkm-system-meta`.
- Purpose: Stable ordering in PARA Projects and consistent linking.
- Reserved ranges:
  - `01-09`: Core system/meta projects
  - `10-49`: Active feature projects
  - `50-89`: Explorations/experiments
  - `90-99`: Legacy/imported

## Cross-Project Connections

### PKM System Integration
All projects integrate with PKM system for knowledge capture and retrieval.

### Compound Engineering Thread  
Strong connection between theoretical framework (11) and practical implementation (12).

### Claude Code Integration
All projects leverage Claude Code agent system with MCP architecture patterns.

## Legacy Notes
- `pkm-system` (legacy) â†’ merged into `01-pkm-system-meta`
- New projects must follow the `NN-kebab-slug` format
