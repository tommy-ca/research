## Migration from Previous Task Structure

### Replaced Tasks
The previous retrieval-focused tasks (RET-001 to RET-040) have been replaced with the compound engineering workstream structure that provides:

1. **Better Parallelization**: WS-B and WS-C can develop simultaneously
2. **Clearer Dependencies**: Foundation components enable engine development
3. **Systematic Architecture**: 4-level abstraction with clear interfaces
4. **Content Creation Integration**: Built-in content creation capabilities
5. **Claude Code Orchestration**: Natural language interface from day one

### Enhanced Scope
The new task structure includes:
- **Content Creation Pipeline**: Full content generation capabilities
- **Multi-Agent Workflows**: Sophisticated agent coordination
- **Interface-Driven Development**: Clear contracts between components
- **Parallel Development**: Maximum efficiency through independent workstreams

### Maintained Quality Standards
All quality standards from the original plan are maintained or enhanced:
- **TDD Methodology**: Test-driven development for all components
- **Performance Targets**: Specific performance requirements for each level
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive validation at each composition level
- **User Experience**: Natural language interface with high success rates

## Implementation Benefits

### Development Efficiency
- **70% Parallel Development**: Simultaneous workstream execution
- **Clear Interfaces**: Prevent integration issues and blocking
- **Independent Testing**: Each component validated separately
- **Systematic Composition**: Complex capabilities from simple components

### Quality Assurance
- **Component Isolation**: Issues contained within boundaries
