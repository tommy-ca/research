# PKM System Task Prioritization Matrix

## Overview

This document provides systematic task prioritization using compound engineering principles, ensuring optimal resource allocation and maximum parallel development efficiency.

## Prioritization Framework

### Priority Levels
- 🔴 **Critical**: Blocks other work, must complete first
- 🟠 **High**: Enables significant value, complete soon
- 🟡 **Medium**: Important but not blocking, schedule flexibly
- 🟢 **Low**: Nice to have, defer to later phases

### Evaluation Criteria
```yaml
blocking_factor:
  weight: 40%
  description: "How many other tasks depend on this"
  scale: "0 (no dependencies) to 10 (blocks everything)"

user_value:
  weight: 30%
  description: "Direct impact on user capability"
  scale: "0 (no user impact) to 10 (core functionality)"

implementation_risk:
  weight: 20%
  description: "Technical complexity and uncertainty"
  scale: "0 (trivial) to 10 (experimental/unknown)"

effort_efficiency:
  weight: 10%
  description: "Value delivered per unit of effort"
  scale: "0 (very inefficient) to 10 (high ROI)"
```

```

### Alternative Scaling Options
```yaml
single_developer:
  approach: "Sequential development with careful prioritization"
  timeline: "10-12 weeks (extended but manageable)"

larger_team:
  approach: "Additional workstreams for advanced features"
  timeline: "6-8 weeks (accelerated with more features)"
  benefits: "Faster delivery, more concurrent features"
```

## Risk-Adjusted Prioritization

### High-Risk Tasks (Require Extra Attention)
```yaml
high_risk_tasks:

    priority_adjustment: "Start earlier, allocate buffer time"
    
  WS-C-001_ContentEngine:
    risk_factors: "AI integration, quality validation"
    mitigation: "Incremental development, user testing"
    priority_adjustment: "Parallel prototyping approach"
    
  WS-D-001_CommandRouter:
    risk_factors: "Natural language parsing, intent recognition"
    mitigation: "Fallback to command mode, gradual NL improvement"
    priority_adjustment: "Build simple first, enhance iteratively"
```

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
```yaml
technical_risks:
  performance_bottlenecks:
    early_action: "Performance testing from day 1"
    checkpoints: "Weekly performance validation"
    fallback: "Optimization sprints as needed"
    
  integration_complexity:
    early_action: "Daily integration testing"
    checkpoints: "Interface compliance validation"
    fallback: "Interface versioning and adapters"
    
  user_experience:
