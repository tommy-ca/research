# PKM System Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

**Implementation Strategy**: Compound Engineering with systematic decomposition, parallel workstreams, and Claude Code orchestration  
**Duration**: 8 weeks (4 workstreams with optimal parallelization)  
**Methodology**: Interface-driven TDD with comprehensive integration testing  
**Success Framework**: 95% objectives completion with quality gates at each level  

## Compound Engineering Implementation Strategy

### Core Principles Applied
1. **Systematic Decomposition**: Complex PKM system broken into 4 abstraction levels
2. **Parallel Development**: Independent workstreams with clear interface contracts
3. **Interface-First Development**: All APIs defined before implementation
4. **Claude Code Orchestration**: Natural language hides system complexity
5. **Progressive Composition**: Simple components build sophisticated capabilities

### 4-Level Architecture
```yaml
abstraction_levels:
  level_1_primitives:
    purpose: "Foundation operations"
    components: [VaultManager, MarkdownParser, IndexManager]
    characteristics: "Fast, reliable, well-tested"
    
  level_2_engines:
    purpose: "Complex operations from primitives"
    components: [RetrievalEngine, ContentEngine]
    characteristics: "Composed, feature-rich, efficient"
    
  level_3_agents:
    purpose: "Natural language interface"
    components: [PkmRetrievalAgent, PkmContentAgent]
    characteristics: "User-friendly, context-aware, intelligent"
    
  level_4_orchestration:
    purpose: "Multi-agent coordination"
    components: [CommandRouter, ClaudeCodeIntegration]
    characteristics: "Seamless, workflow-aware, unified"
```
