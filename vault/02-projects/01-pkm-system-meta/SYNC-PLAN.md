# PKM System Sync Plan

## Current Status

**Date**: 2024-08-23  
**Active PRs**: 
- âœ… **PR #10**: `feat(pkm): retrieval agent + CLI; vault alignment for ingestion` - **MERGED**
- ðŸ”„ **PR #11**: `feat(meta): PKM system meta project organization` - **OPEN & MERGEABLE**

## Sync Strategy

### Phase 1: Meta Project Integration âœ… READY
**Target**: Merge PR #11 to establish organizational foundation

#### Current State
- **Meta Project**: Complete organizational structure created
- **Planning Documents**: 8-week roadmap with 17 detailed tasks  
- **Specifications**: Architecture and implementation framework
- **Quality Standards**: Success criteria and metrics defined
- **Status**: Ready for immediate merge

#### Merge Benefits
- **Central Coordination**: Single source of truth for project management
- **Clear Roadmap**: Systematic development path established
- **Quality Framework**: TDD, specs-driven, FR-first principles
- **Risk Management**: Proactive identification and mitigation strategies

### Phase 2: Implementation Branch Creation ðŸ“… NEXT
**Target**: Create dedicated implementation branch after meta project merge

#### Implementation Strategy
```bash
# After PR #11 merge
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b feature/pkm-retrieval-agent-dev

# Begin systematic implementation
mkdir -p src/pkm/retrieval tests/unit/retrieval
touch src/pkm/__init__.py src/pkm/retrieval/__init__.py

# Start with RET-001: Project structure setup (TDD)
echo "# TDD Implementation Starting Point" > tests/unit/test_retrieval_engine.py
```

#### Development Workflow
1. **Sprint-Based Development**: 8 weeks, 8 sprints, 17 tasks
2. **TDD Mandatory**: All code follows RED â†’ GREEN â†’ REFACTOR cycle
3. **Daily Commits**: Systematic progress with descriptive messages
4. **Weekly Reviews**: Sprint progress and blocker identification

### Phase 3: Integration Points ðŸ”„ ONGOING
**Target**: Maintain alignment between planning and implementation

#### Sync Checkpoints
- **Weekly**: Update STATUS.md with current sprint progress
- **Sprint End**: Review milestones.md and adjust timelines if needed
- **Milestone**: Update success criteria and metrics
- **Phase Complete**: Comprehensive review and next phase planning

#### Documentation Updates
- **Real-time Status**: STATUS.md reflects current development state
- **Task Progress**: phase-2-tasks.md updated with completion status
- **Metrics Tracking**: success-criteria.md with actual vs target metrics
- **Risk Management**: milestones.md updated with risk status

## Merge Sequence

### Step 1: Immediate Merge (Today)
```bash
# Meta project is ready for immediate merge
gh pr review 11 --approve
gh pr merge 11 --squash
```

**Benefits**:
- Establishes organizational foundation
- Provides central coordination hub
- Enables systematic development tracking
- Creates clear accountability framework

### Step 2: Implementation Branch (Tomorrow)
```bash
# Create implementation branch from updated master
git checkout master && git pull
git checkout -b feature/pkm-retrieval-agent-dev

# Begin RET-001: Project structure with TDD
# Follow systematic sprint plan
```

**Focus**:
- TDD-driven development starting with failing tests
- Systematic progression through 17 planned tasks
- Daily progress with quality gates
- Weekly sprint reviews and adjustments

### Step 3: Continuous Integration (Ongoing)
```bash
# Regular sync between planning and implementation
# Update meta project documentation with real progress
# Maintain single source of truth for project status
```

**Cadence**:
- **Daily**: Development commits with progress updates
- **Weekly**: Sprint review and planning adjustments
- **Milestone**: Comprehensive review and metrics update

## Risk Management

### Merge Risks (Low)
- **Conflict Potential**: None - meta project is pure organizational addition
- **Integration Issues**: None - no code conflicts with existing work
- **Dependency Blocks**: None - meta project enhances existing foundation

### Implementation Risks (Managed)
- **Complexity**: Mitigated by detailed task breakdown and TDD approach
- **Scope Creep**: Controlled by FR-first prioritization and strict change control
- **Technical Debt**: Prevented by TDD mandatory approach and quality gates
