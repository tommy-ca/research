# Claude Code Interface Specification for PKM System

## Overview

This document specifies the complete Claude Code interface for the PKM system, including commands, hooks, subagents, and interaction patterns. Claude Code serves as the universal interface, handling all complexity while users work with simple markdown files.

## Architecture Principle

```yaml
principle: "Claude does the heavy lifting"
user_experience: "Simple markdown files in Git"
intelligence: "Claude Code orchestrates everything"
storage: "Lakehouse backend (invisible to users)"
```

            1. Process just the inbox (5 unprocessed notes)
            2. Process today's notes (3 notes)
            3. Deep process everything (127 notes)
            Which would you prefer?"
    
  confirmation:
    user: "Capture this article [URL]"
    claude: "I've captured the article 'Understanding Quantum Computing' 
            and created an atomic note in your inbox. I've also:
            - Extracted 5 key concepts
            - Identified 3 connections to existing notes
            - Added tags: #quantum #computing #physics
            Would you like me to process it deeper?"
    
  proactive_assistance:
    claude: "I noticed you've added 15 notes about machine learning today.
            Would you like me to:
            1. Synthesize them into a summary
            2. Identify learning patterns
            3. Create a study guide
            4. Just organize them by topic"
    
  error_guidance:
    user: "Search for that thing about databases"
    claude: "I need a bit more context. I found several database topics:
            - Database indexing (12 notes)
            - NoSQL databases (8 notes)  
            - Database normalization (5 notes)
            Which area interests you, or shall I show all database notes?"
