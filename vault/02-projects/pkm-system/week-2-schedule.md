# PKM Implementation - Week 2 Schedule

## Week 2: Content Migration & Processing (Jan 22-26, 2024)

### Overview
Focus on migrating existing content to vault structure and implementing basic processing automation.

## Monday, Jan 22 - Migration Planning

### Morning (9:00-12:00)
- [ ] Audit existing content in `docs/`, `resources/`, `experiments/`
- [ ] Create migration map (what goes where in PARA)
- [ ] Identify content for atomic note conversion
- [ ] Set up migration tracking spreadsheet

### Afternoon (13:00-17:00)
- [ ] Begin migrating PKM architecture docs to `vault/3-resources/`
- [ ] Convert long documents to atomic notes
- [ ] Create bidirectional links between related content
- [ ] Update daily note with progress

### End of Day
- [ ] Process any inbox items
- [ ] Git commit migrated content
- [ ] Update project status

## Tuesday, Jan 23 - Architecture Documentation

### Morning (9:00-12:00)
- [ ] Migrate all `/docs/pkm-architecture/` files
- [ ] Create permanent notes for key concepts:
  - [ ] PARA method principles
  - [ ] Zettelkasten methodology
  - [ ] Lakehouse architecture
  - [ ] Lightweight pipeline design

### Afternoon (13:00-17:00)
- [ ] Convert implementation guides to project notes
- [ ] Extract technical decisions as atomic notes
- [ ] Link architecture notes to implementation
- [ ] Create architecture index in permanent notes

### End of Day
- [ ] Run `/pkm-process` on new content
- [ ] Update knowledge graph connections
- [ ] Document migration lessons

## Wednesday, Jan 24 - Research Content

### Morning (9:00-12:00)
- [ ] Migrate research papers from `/resources/papers/`
- [ ] Create literature notes for each paper
- [ ] Extract key findings as atomic notes
- [ ] Build citation network

### Afternoon (13:00-17:00)
- [ ] Process datasets documentation
- [ ] Create resource notes for tools/frameworks
- [ ] Archive outdated research
- [ ] Update research index

### End of Day
- [ ] Tag all research content
- [ ] Create research synthesis note
- [ ] Plan next research directions

## Thursday, Jan 25 - Automation Implementation

### Morning (9:00-12:00)
- [ ] Implement `/pkm-migrate` command for bulk migration
- [ ] Create auto-tagging system based on content
- [ ] Set up link suggestion algorithm
- [ ] Test processing pipeline

### Afternoon (13:00-17:00)
- [ ] Implement `/pkm-extract` for concept extraction
- [ ] Create `/pkm-summarize` for multi-level summaries
- [ ] Set up `/pkm-graph` for visualization prep
- [ ] Document automation workflows

### End of Day
- [ ] Test all new commands
- [ ] Update command documentation
- [ ] Commit automation code

## Friday, Jan 26 - Integration & Review

### Morning (9:00-12:00)
- [ ] Complete remaining content migration
- [ ] Verify all links are working
- [ ] Check for orphan notes
- [ ] Update all indexes

### Afternoon (13:00-17:00)
- [ ] Conduct week 2 review
- [ ] Document migration metrics:
  - [ ] Notes migrated
  - [ ] Atomic notes created
  - [ ] Links established
  - [ ] Processing time
- [ ] Plan week 3 intelligence features

### End of Day
- [ ] Complete weekly review template
- [ ] Archive completed migration tasks
- [ ] Prepare week 3 schedule
- [ ] Celebrate progress! ðŸŽ‰

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] 100% of existing content migrated
- [ ] >50 atomic notes created
- [ ] >100 bidirectional links
- [ ] All projects tracked in vault
- [ ] Zero orphan notes

### Qualitative
- [ ] Content is more discoverable
- [ ] Knowledge connections visible
- [ ] Daily workflow established
- [ ] Automation reducing friction
- [ ] System feels natural to use

## Daily Checklist

### Every Morning
- [ ] Create/open daily note
- [ ] Review today's migration tasks
- [ ] Check inbox for new items
- [ ] Update project status

### Every Evening
- [ ] Process inbox to zero
- [ ] Update daily note reflection
- [ ] Commit all changes
- [ ] Plan tomorrow's focus

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Content loss during migration | High | Backup before migration, use git |
| Broken links | Medium | Automated link checker |
| Migration taking too long | Medium | Focus on high-value content first |
| Automation bugs | Low | Test thoroughly, rollback plan |

## Dependencies

### Required Before Start
- [x] Vault structure created
- [x] Templates ready
- [x] Basic commands working
- [x] Git integration set up

### Tools Needed
- [ ] Bulk file operations scripts
- [ ] Link validation tool
- [ ] Content extraction utilities
- [ ] Migration tracking system

## Notes

### Key Decisions
- Migrate by value, not volume (important content first)
- Create atomic notes during migration, not after
- Build links as we go, not in separate pass
- Test automation with small batches first

### Lessons from Week 1
- Templates save significant time
- Daily notes provide continuity
- Inbox prevents overwhelm
- Small commits are better
