- [x] Templates for all note types
- [ ] Claude Code PKM commands operational
- [ ] Git automation configured
- [ ] Daily workflow established
- [ ] Content migration complete
- [ ] NLP processing active
- [ ] Knowledge graph building

## üöÄ Deliverables
1. **Working PKM vault** - Fully organized repository
2. **Automation suite** - Claude commands and Git hooks
3. **Documentation** - Complete user guide
4. **Templates library** - All note types covered
5. **Migration report** - Lessons learned

## üìÖ Timeline
- **Start**: 2024-01-21
- **Phase 1 (Structure)**: Week of Jan 22-26
- **Phase 2 (Migration)**: Week of Jan 29 - Feb 2
- **Phase 3 (Intelligence)**: Week of Feb 5-16
- **Due**: 2024-02-18

- [ ] Create dashboard views

### Completed
- [x] Create vault directory structure
- [x] Write PKM specifications
- [x] Create dogfooding plan
- [x] Set up PARA folders
- [x] Create initial templates
- [x] Write inbox workflow

## üìù Notes

### 2024-01-21
- Created initial vault structure
- Established PARA organization
- Created templates for daily, project, and zettel notes
- Documented dogfooding approach

### Key Decisions
- **FR-First**: Implement features before optimization
- **Lightweight stack**: Python/Rust instead of Java
- **Dual interface**: Text editing + natural language
- **Claude as platform**: Implementation layer for all workflows
