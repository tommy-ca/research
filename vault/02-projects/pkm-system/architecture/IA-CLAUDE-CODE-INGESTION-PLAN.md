# Ingestion Plan: Using Claude Code for Information Architecture

## Overview
Plan ingestion and validation for the inbox article/note on "Using Claude Code for Information Architecture" to integrate insights into the PKM system and inform IA workflows.

## Objectives
- Establish a reproducible ingestion workflow for IA-related resources
- Capture metadata, links, and tags consistently
- Validate outputs via peer-review and acceptance criteria

## Scope
- Source: Inbox note `vault/0-inbox/202508231430-using-claude-code-for-information-architecture.md` and referenced resources (Arango article)
- Outputs: Processed note in PARA, atomic notes if needed, linked resources, review report

## Inputs
- Inbox note: [[202508231430-using-claude-code-for-information-architecture]]
- Resource: [[claude-code-ia-integration]]
- Related: [[claude-code-for-information-architecture]], [[agentic-tools-for-ia]], [[content-as-code-approach]]

## Workflow
1. Capture
   - Ensure inbox note has complete frontmatter and source link(s)
2. Process
   - Extract key concepts → candidate atomic notes
   - Generate tags and bidirectional links
3. Organize (PARA)
   - Place project-related items under `vault/01-projects/claude-code-ia-implementation/`
   - Reference architecture artifacts in `vault/02-projects/pkm-system/architecture/`
4. Review
   - Run peer-review checklist (see Review doc)
5. Index
   - Update indices and link density

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Inbox note processed into correct PARA location(s)
- [ ] Frontmatter present on all resulting notes
- [ ] At least 3 bidirectional links per atomic note
- [ ] Clear provenance (source URL, date)
- [ ] Review document completed with recommendations

## Test Plan
- Unit: Validate ingestion CLI writes to `vault/0-inbox/` with correct metadata
- Integration: Run `scripts/pkm_ingest_pipeline.py` on a sample IA markdown, verify processing
- QA: Manual checklist pass (see Review)

## Risks & Mitigations
- Ambiguous categorization → Use PARA decision notes, defer if unclear
- Link gaps → Run `/pkm-link` to suggest connections

## Next Steps
- Execute ingestion on inbox article
- Complete Review document and close checklist
