# PKM Migration Status Report

## Migration Progress (Day 1 of Week 2)

### ✅ Completed Tasks

#### 1. Content Audit
- Analyzed 57 docs files
- Identified 10+ Claude agents
- Mapped knowledge-base structure
- Created comprehensive migration map

#### 2. Directory Structure Created
```

├── 1-projects/pkm-system/
│   ├── architecture/     ✅ Created
│   └── implementation/   ✅ Created
├── 2-areas/
│   ├── knowledge-mgmt/   ✅ Created

└── 3-resources/
    ├── architecture/     ✅ Created
    ├── specifications/   ✅ Created
    └── frameworks/       ✅ Created
```

#### 3. Files Migrated

##### To Projects (Active Work)
- ✅ `PKM-SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md` → `vault/1-projects/pkm-system/architecture/`
- ✅ `PKM-SYSTEM-SPECIFICATION.md` → `vault/1-projects/pkm-system/architecture/`
- ✅ `CLAUDE-INTERFACE-SPECIFICATION.md` → `vault/1-projects/pkm-system/architecture/`
- ✅ `WORKFLOW-IMPLEMENTATION-SPECIFICATION.md` → `vault/1-projects/pkm-system/architecture/`
- ✅ `IMPLEMENTATION-*.md` → `vault/1-projects/pkm-system/implementation/`
- ✅ `STEERING-DOCUMENT.md` → `vault/1-projects/pkm-system/`

##### To Resources (Reference)
- ✅ `LAKEHOUSE-*.md` → `vault/3-resources/architecture/lakehouse/`
- ✅ `STORAGE-ARCHITECTURE.md` → `vault/3-resources/architecture/storage/`

##### To Areas (Ongoing)
- ✅ PKM agents → `vault/2-areas/knowledge-mgmt/agents/`
- ✅ Research agents → `vault/2-areas/learning/research-methods/`
- ✅ Synthesis agents → `vault/2-areas/learning/synthesis/`

#### 4. Atomic Notes Created
Extracted from long documents into permanent notes:
1. ✅ `202401210005-para-method-principles.md`
2. ✅ `202401210006-zettelkasten-principles.md`
3. ✅ `202401210007-atomic-notes-concept.md`

#### 5. Links Established
- Created bidirectional links between all atomic notes
- Updated permanent index with new entries
- Maintained zero orphan notes

## Current Status

### Metrics
- **Files Migrated**: 15 of 57 docs (26%)
- **Atomic Notes Created**: 7 total (3 new today)
- **Links Created**: 20+
- **Orphan Files**: 0
- **PARA Organization**: 100% for migrated content

### Time Investment
- Content audit: 30 minutes
- Migration setup: 20 minutes
- File migration: 30 minutes
- Atomic note creation: 40 minutes
- **Total Day 1**: 2 hours

## Remaining Work

### High Priority (Day 2)
- [ ] Migrate remaining PKM architecture docs
- [ ] Process knowledge-base concepts
- [ ] Extract more atomic notes from specifications
- [ ] Create bidirectional links for new content

### Medium Priority (Day 3)
- [ ] Migrate experiments directory
- [ ] Process investment strategies
- [ ] Convert frameworks to atomic notes

### Low Priority (Day 4-5)
- [ ] Archive old documentation
- [ ] Clean up duplicates
- [ ] Update all relative links
- [ ] Create migration automation scripts

## Insights & Learnings

### What's Working
1. **PARA method** provides clear categorization
2. **Atomic notes** forcing clarity of thought
3. **Migration map** keeps process organized
4. **Incremental approach** maintains momentum

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Long documents** require significant extraction effort
2. **Link updates** need careful attention
3. **Categorization decisions** sometimes ambiguous

### Process Improvements
1. **Batch similar content** for efficiency
2. **Create templates** for common note types
3. **Use scripts** for bulk operations
4. **Track metrics** for motivation

## Next Actions (Day 2)

### Morning Session
1. [ ] Complete PKM architecture migration
2. [ ] Extract 5 more atomic notes
3. [ ] Update permanent index

### Afternoon Session
1. [ ] Migrate knowledge-base concepts
2. [ ] Create concept relationship map
3. [ ] Build cross-domain links

## Success Indicators

### Day 1 ✅
- [x] Migration map created
- [x] Directory structure established
- [x] Core documents migrated
- [x] Atomic notes extracted
- [x] No orphan files

### Week 2 Goals
- [ ] 100% content migrated (57 files)
- [ ] 50+ atomic notes created
- [ ] 100+ bidirectional links
- [ ] Complete PARA organization
- [ ] Zero legacy structure remaining

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Prioritize active projects** over reference materials
2. **Extract atomic notes** during migration, not after
3. **Maintain original files** until migration complete
4. **Create links immediately** to avoid orphans

## Quote of the Day

> "Migration is not just moving files, it's transforming knowledge into a living system"
