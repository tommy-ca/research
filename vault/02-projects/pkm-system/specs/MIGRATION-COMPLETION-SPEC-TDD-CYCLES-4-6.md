# PKM Migration Completion Specification - TDD Cycles 4-6

**Document Type**: Technical Specification  
**Priority**: P0 (Blocking intelligence development)  
**TDD Cycles**: 4, 5, 6  
**Target**: 95%+ migration completion (≤3 files remaining in docs/)  

---

## Executive Summary

This specification defines the completion of PKM content migration from docs/ to vault/ structure using Test-Driven Development methodology. Current status: 79% complete (216 vault files vs 57 docs files remaining). Target: 95%+ completion to unblock intelligence feature development.

**Critical Insight**: Intelligence features cannot be properly implemented without complete access to all PKM specifications and architecture documents currently scattered between docs/ and vault/ directories.

---

## Current State Analysis

### **Accurate Migration Metrics**
- **Files**: 216 migrated, 57 remaining (**79% complete**)
- **Content**: ~50,000+ lines migrated, 28,623 lines remaining (**~64% complete**)
- **Critical Documents**: Many core architecture specs still in docs/

### **Remaining Content Analysis**
```
docs/ Directory Structure (57 files remaining):
├── pkm-architecture/ (19 files - CRITICAL)
│   ├── PKM-SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md
│   ├── PKM-SYSTEM-SPECIFICATION.md
│   ├── KNOWLEDGE-EXTRACTION-FRAMEWORK.md
│   ├── LAKEHOUSE-ARCHITECTURE.md
│   ├── STORAGE-ARCHITECTURE.md
│   └── [14 more architecture files]
├── RESEARCH_AGENTS.md
├── feynman-first-principles-pkm-research.md
└── [36 more files]
```

### **Migration Impact Assessment**
- **Development Blocker**: Core specs scattered prevents proper intelligence implementation
- **Knowledge Fragmentation**: PKM system doesn't follow its own organization principles
- **Search Inefficiency**: Critical information not discoverable through unified vault system
- **Quality Inconsistency**: Some content atomic-ized, other content still in long documents

## TDD Cycle 4: Advanced Migration Pipeline

**Duration**: Days 1-2  
**Focus**: Robust migration infrastructure for remaining content

### **Functional Requirements**

#### FR-M4-001: Batch Architecture Document Processing

    source_dir = "docs/pkm-architecture/"
    target_dir = "vault/02-projects/pkm-system/architecture/"
    
    result = migration_pipeline.migrate_architecture_documents(source_dir)
    
    assert result.files_migrated == 19
    assert result.atomic_notes_created >= 30  # ~2 per document average
    assert result.quality_score >= 0.85
    assert len(list(Path("docs/pkm-architecture/").glob("*.md"))) == 0  # All moved

    assert len(result.atomic_notes) >= 5
    assert all(note.type == "specification-concept" for note in result.atomic_notes)
    assert all(len(note.content) < 800 for note in result.atomic_notes)  # Atomic size

    def migrate_architecture_documents(self, source_dir: str) -> MigrationResult:
        """Migrate architecture documents with specialized processing"""
        # Implementation with atomic extraction, quality gates, cross-referencing
        
    def enforce_quality_gates(self, migration_result: MigrationResult) -> bool:
        """Enforce quality standards before considering migration complete"""

## Success Criteria & Quality Gates

### **Migration Completion Gates**

#### **Gate 1: File Migration (Target: 95%)**
- [ ] ≤3 files remaining in docs/ directory
- [ ] All critical architecture documents migrated
- [ ] All agent specifications processed
- [ ] All research documents atomized

#### **Gate 2: Content Quality (Target: 90%)**
- [ ] 98%+ files have complete frontmatter
- [ ] 95%+ files properly PARA categorized  
- [ ] 90%+ content has atomic note extraction
- [ ] All links validated and functional

#### **Gate 3: Knowledge Graph (Target: 80%)**
- [ ] ≥50 atomic concept nodes created
- [ ] ≥3.0 average connections per node
- [ ] ≤5 orphan nodes remaining
- [ ] Cross-domain connections established

#### **Gate 4: System Integrity (Target: 95%)**
- [ ] All PKM specifications discoverable in vault
- [ ] Search system returns all relevant architecture info
- [ ] No information silos between docs/ and vault/
- [ ] Complete development workflow using vault only

### **Completion Verification Process**

#### **Automated Validation**
```bash
# Run comprehensive migration validation
python vault/02-projects/pkm-system/scripts/validate-migration-completion.py

# Expected output:
# ✅ File Migration: 97% complete (2 files remaining)
# ✅ Content Quality: 94% meeting standards  
# ✅ Knowledge Graph: 85% completeness
# ✅ System Integrity: 96% vault-discoverable
# 🎯 Overall Completion: 95.5% - PASSED ✅
```

#### **Manual Verification**
1. **Developer Test**: Can all PKM architecture info be found in vault?
2. **Search Test**: Does vault search return comprehensive results?
3. **Workflow Test**: Can development proceed using only vault structure?
4. **Knowledge Test**: Are key concepts discoverable as atomic notes?

## Dependencies & Blockers

### **Prerequisites** 
- ✅ TDD Cycles 1-3 complete (Capture, Inbox Processing, Atomic Notes)
- ✅ BasePkmProcessor with common patterns
- ✅ PARA vault structure established
- ✅ Quality migration pipeline proven

### **External Dependencies**
- Python YAML library (already available)
- Existing atomic note extraction algorithms
- PARA categorization logic from TDD Cycle 2

### **Potential Blockers**
- **Content Complexity**: Some architecture documents may require manual review
- **Quality Standards**: High quality bar may require iteration
- **Cross-References**: Complex document relationships may need careful handling

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Iterative Quality**: Start with 80% quality, iterate to 95%
- **Manual Fallback**: Flag complex documents for manual review
- **Quality Monitoring**: Continuous validation during migration process

---

## Post-Completion Validation

### **Intelligence Readiness Test**
Once migration completion is achieved, verify system is ready for intelligence features:

```python
def test_system_ready_for_intelligence_features():
    """Verify system is ready for Week 2 intelligence development"""
    # All architecture specs accessible in vault
    arch_specs = search_vault("PKM architecture")
    assert len(arch_specs) >= 15
    
    # Complete knowledge graph available  
    graph = build_knowledge_graph()
    assert graph.node_count >= 50
    
    # No critical information in docs/
    remaining_docs = count_files("docs/")
    assert remaining_docs <= 3
    
    # Comprehensive atomic note coverage
    atomic_notes = count_atomic_notes()
    assert atomic_notes >= 75
```

Only after this test passes should development proceed to intelligence features.

---

## Conclusion

Migration completion is the critical prerequisite for intelligence development. This specification ensures systematic, tested, and high-quality completion of the PKM content migration from docs/ to organized vault/ structure.

**Success Definition**: 95%+ content migrated with comprehensive atomic note extraction and quality validation, enabling unified access to all PKM specifications through vault structure.

**Next Phase Blocker**: Intelligence features (TDD Cycles 7-9) are blocked until this specification is fully implemented and validated.
