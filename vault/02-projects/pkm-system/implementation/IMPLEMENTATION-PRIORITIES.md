## Development Principles

### FR-First Principles
1. **Ship working features fast**
2. **Optimize only when needed**
3. **Use lightweight tools**
4. **Defer complex infrastructure**
5. **Focus on user value**

### What We're NOT Doing (Yet)
- ❌ Setting up distributed clusters
- ❌ Optimizing for millions of notes
- ❌ Building perfect infrastructure
- ❌ Implementing all security features
- ❌ Creating monitoring dashboards

### What We ARE Doing
- ✅ Making notes work
- ✅ Adding Claude intelligence
- ✅ Processing content
- ✅ Generating insights
- ✅ Creating value quickly

## Risk Management

### Mitigated Risks
- **Complexity**: Using simple Python/Rust tools
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external services
- **Performance**: Good enough for MVP
- **Scale**: Handle thousands of notes first

### Accepted Risks
- Not web-scale initially
- Basic security only
- Local-first architecture
- Limited concurrent users
- Manual deployment

## Resource Allocation

### Developer Focus
```yaml
week_1_4:
  focus: "Core PKM features"
  avoid: "Infrastructure complexity"
  
week_5_8:
  focus: "Processing pipeline"
  avoid: "Premature optimization"
  
week_9_12:
  focus: "Intelligence features"
  avoid: "Perfect architecture"
  
week_13_16:
  focus: "Storage basics"
  avoid: "Enterprise features"
```

## Communication Strategy

### Weekly Updates
- **Week 1-4**: "Basic PKM working!"
- **Week 5-8**: "Smart processing added!"
- **Week 9-12**: "Insights discovered!"
- **Week 13-16**: "Persistent storage ready!"

### NOT Mentioning
- Technical debt (intentional)
- Performance limitations (expected)
- Security gaps (planned)
- Scalability limits (acceptable)
