# üöÄ PKM System TDD and Specs-Driven Development Workflow

**Ultra-comprehensive development methodology for building production-ready PKM system with quality, speed, and user value**

## üéØ STRATEGIC TRANSITION

### From Migration to Development
**Phase 2 Complete**: Content migration successful (129 files, 23 atomic notes)
**Phase 3 Focus**: PKM system feature development with TDD/specs-driven approach
**Objective**: Build operational PKM system with automated testing and quality assurance

### Development Philosophy
- **Specs First**: Every feature starts with complete specification
- **Test-Driven**: Write tests before implementation (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- **FR-First**: Functional requirements over non-functional requirements
- **User Value**: Deliver working features in days, not weeks

## üìã TDD AND SPECS-DRIVEN WORKFLOW

### The Five-Stage Development Cycle

#### Stage 1: SPECIFICATION (Specs-Driven)
```yaml
specification_phase:
  duration: 30-60 minutes per feature
  deliverables:
    - feature_specification.md
    - acceptance_criteria.md
    - test_cases.md
  
  process:
    1. Define functional requirements (FRs)
    2. Defer non-functional requirements (NFRs)
    3. Write acceptance criteria
    4. Design test cases
    5. Stakeholder review and approval
```

#### Stage 2: TEST DEFINITION (Test-Driven)
```yaml
test_definition_phase:
  duration: 45-90 minutes per feature
  deliverables:
    - test_feature.py
    - test_integration.py
    - test_acceptance.py
  
  process:
    1. Write unit tests (RED phase)
    2. Write integration tests
    3. Write acceptance tests
    4. Ensure all tests fail initially
    5. Test coverage validation
```

#### Stage 3: IMPLEMENTATION (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
```yaml
implementation_phase:
  duration: 2-6 hours per feature
  deliverables:
    - feature_implementation.py
    - integration_code.py
    - documentation.md
  
  process:
    1. RED: Confirm tests fail
    2. GREEN: Minimal code to pass tests
    3. REFACTOR: Improve code quality
    4. Repeat cycle for each test
    5. Integration validation
```

#### Stage 4: VALIDATION (Quality Gates)
```yaml
validation_phase:
  duration: 30-45 minutes per feature
  deliverables:
    - test_report.md
    - quality_metrics.json
    - validation_checklist.md
  
  process:
    1. Run full test suite
    2. Check acceptance criteria
    3. Validate against specification
    4. Performance baseline check
    5. Security validation (basic)
```

#### Stage 5: INTEGRATION (System Testing)
```yaml
integration_phase:
  duration: 30-60 minutes per feature
  deliverables:
    - integration_report.md
    - user_acceptance_test.md
    - feature_complete.md
  
  process:
    1. System integration testing
    2. User acceptance testing
    3. Documentation update
    4. Feature flag deployment
    5. Monitoring setup (basic)
```
