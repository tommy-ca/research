# PKM Implementation Schedule v2.0 - Lightweight FR-First Approach

## Executive Summary

This schedule reflects the complete transition to a lightweight Python/Rust architecture with functional requirements prioritized over non-functional requirements. The new approach delivers core PKM functionality in 4 weeks instead of 4 months.

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Removed all Java dependencies (Kafka, Spark, Neo4j, EMR)
- ✅ Adopted Python/Rust stack (Fluvio, Arroyo, Daft+Ray, DuckDB)
- ✅ FR-first: User features before infrastructure
- ✅ 75-85% cost reduction
- ✅ 10x faster deployment
