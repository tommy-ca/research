# First Principles Currency Valuation Framework

## What is First Principles Thinking?

**Elon Musk's Definition**: "Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there."

**Applied to Currency**: Strip away all complexity, opinions, and conventional wisdom. Start with the most basic truths about what currency is and build up logical conclusions.

## Core Axioms (Fundamental Truths)

### Axiom 1: Currency is a Medium of Exchange
**Truth**: Currency exists to facilitate trade between parties who don't want to barter directly.
**Implication**: Currency value derives from its utility in facilitating economic transactions.

### Axiom 2: Value is Determined by Supply and Demand
**Truth**: The price of anything (including currency) is where supply meets demand.
**Implication**: All currency valuation ultimately reduces to supply/demand dynamics.

### Axiom 3: Humans Act to Maximize Their Own Benefit
**Truth**: Economic actors generally make decisions they believe will improve their situation.
**Implication**: Currency movements reflect collective human decisions seeking advantage.

### Axiom 4: Information Changes Behavior
**Truth**: New information causes people to change their decisions.
**Implication**: Currency values change when new information arrives.

### Axiom 5: Scarcity Creates Value
**Truth**: Things that are limited in quantity tend to have more value than abundant things.
**Implication**: Currencies with controlled/limited supply tend to be more valuable.

## The Fundamental Question Hierarchy

### Level 1: What IS Currency?
**Answer**: A standardized unit of account backed by trust in an issuing authority.

**Components**:
- **Physical/Digital Tokens**: The actual currency units
- **Issuing Authority**: Government/central bank that creates and controls supply
- **Trust System**: Collective belief that others will accept the currency

### Level 2: Why Does Currency Have Value?
**Answer**: Because people collectively agree it has value AND it's useful for transactions.

**Value Sources**:
1. **Network Effect**: More people accepting it → More valuable
2. **Legal Tender**: Government requires its use for taxes
3. **Store of Value**: Maintains purchasing power over time
4. **Unit of Account**: Standard for measuring economic value

### Level 3: What Determines Exchange Rates?
**Answer**: The relative supply and demand for each currency in the global market.

**Fundamental Equation**:
```
Exchange Rate = (Demand for Currency A / Supply of Currency A) / (Demand for Currency B / Supply of Currency B)
```

## Supply Side Analysis (First Principles)

### Primary Supply Factors

#### 1. Monetary Base (M0)
**Definition**: Physical currency + bank reserves at central bank
**First Principle**: The foundation of all money supply
**Control Mechanism**: Central bank direct creation/destruction

**Analysis Framework**:
```
M0 Growth Rate = New Money Created / Existing M0
Real M0 Growth = Nominal M0 Growth - GDP Growth
Currency Impact = -α × Real M0 Growth (α ≈ 0.7 empirically)
```

#### 2. Money Multiplier Effect
**Mechanism**: Banks create money through lending
**Formula**: `Total Money Supply = M0 × Money Multiplier`
**First Principle**: Banking system amplifies base money changes

**Multiplier Calculation**:
```
Money Multiplier = 1 / (Reserve Requirement + Excess Reserves Ratio + Currency Ratio)
```

#### 3. Velocity Considerations
**Definition**: How often money changes hands
**First Principle**: Fast-moving money acts like larger supply
**Formula**: `Effective Money Supply = M × V`

### Supply Elasticity Analysis

**Short-term** (days-weeks): Very inelastic - central banks don't change policy frequently
**Medium-term** (months): Moderate elasticity - policy adjustments possible
**Long-term** (years): High elasticity - major policy regime changes possible

---

## Demand Side Analysis (First Principles)

### Primary Demand Drivers

#### 1. Transaction Demand
**Purpose**: Currency needed for trade and commerce
**Formula**: `Transaction Demand = k × GDP × Price Level`
**First Principle**: Economic activity requires money to function

**Sub-components**:
- **Domestic transactions**: Local economic activity
- **International trade**: Import/export settlements
- **Financial markets**: Investment flows

#### 2. Store of Value Demand
**Purpose**: Preserve wealth over time
**First Principle**: People want to maintain purchasing power

**Factors**:
- **Inflation expectations**: Lower expected inflation = higher demand
- **Political stability**: Stable government = predictable currency
- **Economic growth**: Growing economy = appreciating currency

#### 3. Speculative Demand
**Purpose**: Profit from currency movements
**First Principle**: Traders buy what they expect to rise, sell what they expect to fall

**Components**:
- **Momentum trading**: Following trends
- **Mean reversion**: Betting on return to average
- **Carry trading**: Earning interest rate differentials

#### 4. Reserve Demand
**Purpose**: Central banks holding foreign currencies
**First Principle**: Countries need foreign currency reserves for stability

**Determinants**:
- **Trade volume**: More trade = need more reserves
- **Currency stability**: Unstable currency = need more reserves
- **Economic size**: Larger economy = larger reserve needs

## The Physics of Currency Markets

### Force Analogy
Think of currency markets like physics:

**Currency Price = f(Net Force)**

Where Net Force = Supply Pressure - Demand Pressure

### Equilibrium Analysis

**Static Equilibrium**: When supply and demand forces balance
```
Supply Force = Demand Force
Currency Price = Stable
```

**Dynamic Equilibrium**: Forces constantly changing but balanced on average
```
∫(Supply Force - Demand Force)dt = 0
Currency Price = Trending but stable
```

**Disequilibrium**: Forces unbalanced
```
Supply Force ≠ Demand Force
Currency Price = Rapidly changing
```

## Mathematical Framework

### Base Valuation Model

Starting from first principles, currency value can be expressed as:

```
Currency_Value = f(Economic_Output, Money_Supply, Interest_Rates, Risk_Premium, Network_Effects)
```

### Expanded Mathematical Model

```
log(Exchange_Rate) = β₀ + β₁×log(GDP_Ratio) + β₂×log(Money_Supply_Ratio) + 
                     β₃×(Interest_Rate_Differential) + β₄×(Risk_Premium) + 
                     β₅×log(Trade_Volume_Ratio) + ε
```

**Where**:
- GDP_Ratio = Country A GDP / Country B GDP
- Money_Supply_Ratio = Country A M2 / Country B M2
- Interest_Rate_Differential = Country A Rate - Country B Rate
- Risk_Premium = Sovereign risk spread
- Trade_Volume_Ratio = Trade with A / Trade with B

### Expected Coefficients (Based on Theory)
- β₁ > 0 (Higher economic output → stronger currency)
- β₂ < 0 (Higher money supply → weaker currency)
- β₃ > 0 (Higher interest rates → stronger currency)
- β₄ < 0 (Higher risk → weaker currency)
- β₅ > 0 (More trade → stronger currency)

## Causal Chain Analysis

### From Central Bank Action to Exchange Rate

**Step 1**: Central bank changes interest rate
**Step 2**: Money supply growth rate changes
**Step 3**: Domestic demand for currency changes
**Step 4**: International capital flows respond
**Step 5**: Supply/demand balance shifts
**Step 6**: Exchange rate adjusts

**Time Lags**:
- Step 1→2: Immediate (seconds)
- Step 2→3: 1-4 weeks
- Step 3→4: 1-6 months  
- Step 4→5: Immediate
- Step 5→6: Immediate

### From Economic News to Price Movement

**Step 1**: New economic data released
**Step 2**: Market participants update expectations
**Step 3**: Expected future supply/demand changes
**Step 4**: Current trading decisions change
**Step 5**: Price moves immediately

**Efficiency**: Major currencies incorporate news in 1-15 minutes

## Logical Reasoning Framework

### If-Then Logic Chains

#### Chain 1: Money Supply
```
IF central bank increases money supply
THEN more currency units exist
THEN each unit represents smaller fraction of economy  
THEN purchasing power per unit decreases
THEN currency weakens vs other currencies
```

#### Chain 2: Interest Rates
```
IF country raises interest rates
THEN returns on that currency increase
THEN international investors want that currency
THEN demand for currency increases
THEN currency strengthens
```

#### Chain 3: Economic Growth
```
IF country's economy grows faster
THEN more goods/services produced
THEN each currency unit can buy more real value
THEN currency becomes more attractive
THEN currency strengthens
```

### Contradiction Testing

**Test**: Can a currency simultaneously strengthen from higher interest rates AND weaken from higher money supply?

**Answer**: Yes, depends on relative magnitude and timing:
- Short-term: Interest rate effect dominates
- Long-term: Money supply effect dominates

---

## Empirical Validation Requirements

### What Would Prove the Framework Wrong?

1. **Money supply increases consistently strengthen currency**
2. **Higher interest rates consistently weaken currency**
3. **Economic growth consistently weakens currency**
4. **Exchange rates move randomly with no relationship to fundamentals**

### What Would Prove the Framework Right?

1. **Money supply growth correlates negatively with currency strength**
2. **Interest rate increases correlate positively with currency strength**
3. **Economic growth correlates positively with currency strength**
4. **Exchange rates mean-revert toward fundamental values**

---

## Decision Tree for Currency Analysis

```
1. Is money supply growing faster than economy?
   YES → Negative factor for currency
   NO → Neutral/positive factor

2. Are interest rates rising relative to other countries?
   YES → Positive factor for currency
   NO → Negative factor

3. Is economic growth accelerating?
   YES → Positive factor for currency
   NO → Negative factor

4. Is political/economic stability improving?
   YES → Positive factor for currency
   NO → Negative factor

5. Are trade balances improving?
   YES → Positive factor for currency
   NO → Negative factor

Net Assessment: Count positive vs negative factors
Strong Currency: 4-5 positive factors
Weak Currency: 4-5 negative factors
Neutral: 2-3 positive factors
```

## Common Logical Fallacies to Avoid

### 1. Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc
**Fallacy**: "Currency fell after money supply increased, therefore money supply caused the fall."
**Reality**: Correlation ≠ causation. Multiple factors always at play.

### 2. Composition Fallacy
**Fallacy**: "If everyone buys USD, USD will strengthen indefinitely."
**Reality**: Rising USD makes US exports expensive, eventually reversing the trend.

### 3. Survivorship Bias
**Fallacy**: "Swiss Franc is always strong because of conservative monetary policy."
**Reality**: We only observe currencies that survived; many currencies collapsed.

### 4. Availability Heuristic
**Fallacy**: "Recent currency crashes mean FX markets are always volatile."
**Reality**: Dramatic events are more memorable than normal periods.

## Practical Application Steps

### Step 1: Data Collection
Gather fundamental data for both currencies:
- GDP growth rates
- Money supply growth rates  
- Interest rates
- Inflation rates
- Trade balances
- Political stability indices

### Step 2: Calculate Ratios
Convert absolute data to relative comparisons:
```
Growth_Ratio = GDP_Growth_A / GDP_Growth_B
Money_Ratio = Money_Growth_A / Money_Growth_B
Rate_Differential = Interest_Rate_A - Interest_Rate_B
```

### Step 3: Apply Framework
Use decision tree and mathematical models to assess direction

### Step 4: Validate Against Market
Compare theoretical fair value to current market price

### Step 5: Risk Assessment
Identify factors that could invalidate the analysis

## Limitations of First Principles Approach

### 1. Complexity Reduction
**Issue**: Real markets have thousands of variables
**Mitigation**: Focus on variables with highest explanatory power

### 2. Human Psychology
**Issue**: Markets driven by emotions, not just logic
**Mitigation**: Include risk sentiment in framework

### 3. Regime Changes
**Issue**: Fundamental relationships can break down
**Mitigation**: Regular framework updates based on new data

### 4. Time Horizons
**Issue**: Short-term movements often contradict fundamentals
**Mitigation**: Specify time horizon for each prediction

## Conclusion: The Irreducible Core

After stripping away all complexity, currency valuation reduces to:

**Supply**: How much currency exists
**Demand**: How much people want that currency  
**Time**: How these change over time
**Psychology**: How people perceive these changes

Everything else is elaboration on these four fundamental concepts.
