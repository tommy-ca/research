# Claude Code Integration for PKM Information Architecture

This resource documents how Jorge Arango's approach to using Claude Code for information architecture can enhance our PKM system implementation.

## Key Integration Opportunities

### 1. Vault-Wide Taxonomy Generation
Apply the "content as code" approach to our entire vault:
```bash
# Use Claude Code to analyze our vault structure
claude-code vault/

# Prompt: "Analyze this PKM vault and suggest improved taxonomies for the PARA method implementation"
```

### 2. Automated Content Categorization
Leverage Claude Code's ability to understand content architecture:
- Analyze inbox items for automatic PARA categorization
- Suggest optimal folder placement based on content analysis
- Generate tag hierarchies from content patterns

### 3. Knowledge Graph Enhancement
Use holistic analysis capabilities to:
- Identify missing links between notes
- Suggest new atomic note extractions
- Map concept relationships across the vault

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Analysis and Understanding
1. Use Claude Code to analyze current vault structure
2. Generate baseline taxonomy from existing content
3. Identify organizational patterns and gaps

### Phase 2: Taxonomy Development
1. Generate multiple taxonomy options:
   - Content-type based (notes, projects, resources)
   - Topic-based (technical, conceptual, methodological)
   - Workflow-based (capture, process, synthesize)
2. Test taxonomies against real content
3. Refine based on PKM workflow needs

### Phase 3: Automation Integration
1. Create PKM commands that leverage Claude Code:
   - `/pkm-analyze-vault` - Full vault analysis
   - `/pkm-suggest-taxonomy` - Generate categorization schemes
   - `/pkm-reorganize` - Propose structural improvements
2. Integrate with existing PKM workflows
3. Add to automated processing pipeline

## Specific PKM Enhancements

### For Inbox Processing
```python
# Pseudo-code for Claude Code integration
def process_inbox_with_claude(note_path):
    # Claude Code analyzes note content
    analysis = claude.analyze_content(note_path)
    
    # Suggests PARA category
    category = claude.suggest_para_category(analysis)
    
    # Generates tags
    tags = claude.generate_tags(analysis)
    
    # Identifies related notes
    links = claude.find_related_notes(analysis, vault_path)
    
    return {
        'category': category,
        'tags': tags,
        'links': links
    }
```

### For Knowledge Synthesis
- Use Claude Code to identify patterns across daily notes
- Generate synthesis suggestions from related atomic notes
- Create knowledge maps from vault content

## Benefits for Our PKM System

1. **Faster Processing**: Reduce inbox processing from 5 min to <1 min per item
2. **Better Organization**: AI-suggested categorization based on content analysis
3. **Richer Connections**: Automated link discovery across entire vault
4. **Dynamic Evolution**: Taxonomies that adapt as vault grows

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Requirements
- Vault must be in plain text format (âœ“ Already using Markdown)
- Need Claude Code API access or CLI integration
- Backup strategy for any automated reorganization

### Workflow Integration
- Add as optional enhancement to existing workflows
- Human validation remains critical
- Start with read-only analysis before modifications

### Quality Control
- Test taxonomies with subset of content first
- Validate suggestions against PKM principles
- Monitor for over-categorization or complexity

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Experiment with Claude Code on vault subset
2. [ ] Document specific prompts that work well
3. [ ] Create integration scripts for PKM commands
4. [ ] Test automated categorization accuracy
5. [ ] Develop feedback loop for continuous improvement
