# Fundamental Currency Valuation Theories

## First Principles Approach

### What is Currency Value? (Feynman Technique)

Imagine currency as tickets to a concert. The value of each ticket depends on:
- How many people want to go (demand)
- How many tickets exist (supply) 
- How easy it is to buy/sell tickets (liquidity)
- How good the concert is expected to be (economic fundamentals)

Currency value works similarly - it's the "purchasing power" each unit has relative to other currencies.

## Core Valuation Theories

### 1. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

**First Principle**: Currency should trade at rates that equalize purchasing power across countries.

**Simple Explanation**: If a burger costs $5 in the US and Â£4 in the UK, the exchange rate should be 1.25 USD/GBP. If it's not, arbitrage opportunities exist.

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
S = P_domestic / P_foreign
```
Where S = exchange rate, P = price level

**Limitations**:
- Transaction costs
- Non-tradable goods
- Market inefficiencies

### 2. Interest Rate Parity (IRP)

**First Principle**: Currency with higher interest rates should depreciate to prevent risk-free arbitrage.

**Simple Explanation**: If you can earn 5% in USD vs 2% in EUR, everyone would want USD. But the USD must be expected to weaken by ~3% to balance this out.

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
F/S = (1 + i_domestic)/(1 + i_foreign)
```
Where F = forward rate, S = spot rate, i = interest rate

### 3. Balance of Payments Theory

**First Principle**: Currency demand depends on need for that country's goods, services, and investments.

**Components**:
- **Current Account**: Trade balance, services, transfers
- **Capital Account**: Investment flows
- **Official Reserves**: Central bank interventions

### 4. Monetary Theory

**First Principle**: Currency value inversely relates to its supply relative to demand.

**Quantity Theory of Money**:
```
MV = PY
```
Where M = money supply, V = velocity, P = price level, Y = real output

## Advanced Theories

### 1. Portfolio Balance Model

**Concept**: Investors hold portfolios of assets denominated in different currencies based on risk-return profiles.

**Key Factors**:
- Risk premiums
- Asset substitutability
- Expected returns

### 2. News and Expectations Model

**Concept**: Currency moves based on new information and changing expectations about future economic conditions.

**Market Efficiency**: All available information should be reflected in current prices.

## Supply-Side Factors

### Total Currency Issued (Money Supply)

**M0**: Physical currency in circulation
**M1**: M0 + demand deposits
**M2**: M1 + savings deposits, money market funds
**M3**: M2 + large time deposits, institutional money market funds

**First Principle**: More money chasing the same goods = inflation = currency depreciation

### Central Bank Policy

**Tools**:
- Interest rates
- Reserve requirements
- Open market operations
- Forward guidance

**Impact Mechanism**: Policy changes affect money supply, interest rates, and economic expectations.

## Demand-Side Factors

### FX Market Participation

**Market Participants**:
1. **Central Banks**: Policy implementation, reserves management
2. **Commercial Banks**: Customer transactions, proprietary trading
3. **Corporations**: International trade, hedging
4. **Investment Funds**: Portfolio allocation, speculation
5. **Retail Traders**: Speculation, investment

### Trading Volume Impact

**Liquidity Premium**: Higher volume = lower spreads = easier to trade = more attractive

**Price Discovery**: More trading = better price discovery = more efficient valuation
