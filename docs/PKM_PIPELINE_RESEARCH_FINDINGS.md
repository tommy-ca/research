## 1. PKM Methodology Research

### 1.1 PARA Method Analysis

**Source**: Tiago Forte's "Building a Second Brain" and CODE methodology
**Research Focus**: Classification system effectiveness and implementation patterns

#### Key Findings:
- **Four-Category Framework**: Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives provide comprehensive coverage of information types
