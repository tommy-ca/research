# PKM Pipeline LLM Agent System - Steering Document

## Document Information
- **Document Type**: PKM Methodology Governance & Quality Steering
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Created**: 2024-09-05
- **Authority**: PKM System Architecture Board

## Governance Philosophy

### Core Principle: PKM-First AI Enhancement
**The AI serves the PKM methodology, not the reverse.** All LLM agent enhancements must respect, preserve, and amplify established PKM principles rather than replacing or undermining them.

### Steering Mandate
Ensure that LLM agents enhance personal knowledge management workflows while maintaining methodological integrity, user agency, and knowledge quality standards.

## 1. PKM Methodology Governance Framework

### 1.1 Methodological Compliance Standards

#### PARA Method Compliance (Critical)
**Enforcement**: Every content classification must respect PARA principles
