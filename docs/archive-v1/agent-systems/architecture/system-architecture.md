## Architecture Overview

### System Philosophy
The Claude Code multi-agent research system implements a **Specification-Driven Development (SDD) architecture** that ensures enterprise-grade quality, maintainability, and scalability through formal specifications and automated validation.

### Core Design Principles

1. **Specification-First Development**
   - All implementation decisions trace back to formal specifications
   - Automated validation ensures continuous compliance
   - Clear separation between specification and implementation

2. **Quality-Driven Architecture**
   - Built-in quality metrics and validation at every layer
   - Progressive quality refinement through multi-stage gates
   - Real-time quality monitoring and feedback

3. **Modular Component Design**
   - Loosely coupled components with well-defined interfaces
   - Independent deployability and testability
   - Extensible architecture supporting future enhancements

4. **Enterprise Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling through multi-agent coordination
   - Vertical scaling through workflow optimization
   - Resource efficiency and performance optimization
