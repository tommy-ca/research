```

## Implementation Patterns

### Command Processing
```python
class CommandProcessor:
    """Process agent commands with validation"""
    
    def process_command(self, command: str, args: dict):
        # Validate command
        if not self.validate_command(command, args):
            return self.error_response("Invalid command or arguments")
        
        # Route to appropriate handler
        handler = self.get_handler(command)
        
        # Execute with quality monitoring
        with self.quality_monitor():
            result = handler.execute(args)
            
        # Validate output quality
        if not self.validate_output(result):
            return self.enhance_quality(result)
            
        return result
```

### Quality Monitoring
```python
class QualityMonitor:
    """Monitor and ensure quality standards"""
    
    def assess_quality(self, content):
        metrics = {
            'accuracy': self.check_accuracy(content),
            'completeness': self.check_completeness(content),
            'bias': self.check_bias(content),
            'reliability': self.check_reliability(content)
        }
        
        overall_score = self.calculate_weighted_score(metrics)
        return QualityAssessment(metrics, overall_score)
```

### Error Recovery
```python
class ErrorRecovery:
    """Handle errors with appropriate recovery strategies"""
    
    def handle_error(self, error):
        if isinstance(error, RecoverableError):
            return self.recover(error)
        elif isinstance(error, QualityError):
            return self.enhance_quality(error.content)
        else:
            return self.graceful_degradation(error)
```

## Integration with Specification Framework

The simplified agents integrate with the formal specification framework:

1. **Interface Specifications**: Located in `docs/research/agent-systems/specifications/interfaces/`
2. **Behavior Specifications**: Located in `docs/research/agent-systems/specifications/behaviors/`
3. **Quality Specifications**: Located in `docs/research/agent-systems/specifications/quality/`
4. **Workflow Specifications**: Located in `docs/research/agent-systems/specifications/workflows/`

## Compliance Validation

Agents are validated against specifications using:
- `.claude/hooks/specification_compliance_hook.sh`
- `docs/research/agent-systems/steering/compliance/specification-validation-framework.md`

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- Cache research results for 24 hours
- Cache validation results for 1 hour
- Clear cache on quality threshold failure

### Resource Management
- Limit concurrent API calls to 5
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limiting
- Use streaming for large content processing

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Validate command parameters
- Prevent injection attacks

### Data Protection
- No storage of sensitive information
- Audit logging for compliance
- Secure API key management

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection
- Command execution time
- Quality scores
- Error rates
- Resource utilization

### Logging
- Structured logging in JSON format
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
- Rotation policy: Daily, keep 30 days

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- 2GB RAM minimum
- Network access for web searches
- Read/write access to `.claude/` directory

### Configuration
- Settings in `.claude/settings.json`
- Environment variables for API keys
- Feature flags for experimental features
