# Markdown-Based Personal Knowledge Management System Architecture

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive, first-principles-based Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system built on markdown, Git, and agentic tools. This architecture combines proven PKM methodologies with Feynman learning techniques and cognitive science principles to create a powerful, extensible knowledge ecosystem.

## Core Philosophy

### First Principles Foundation
1. **Knowledge is atomic** - Every piece of knowledge can be broken down to irreducible units
2. **Understanding requires explanation** - True comprehension comes from teaching ability  
3. **Connections create insight** - Knowledge value multiplies through relationships
4. **Simplicity enables complexity** - Complex understanding emerges from simple, well-connected ideas
5. **Version control is memory** - Knowledge evolution tracking enables learning from past thinking

### Feynman Integration
- Every complex concept must have an ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5) representation
- Knowledge gaps are identified through failed explanation attempts
- Progressive complexity layers from simple to advanced understanding
- Teaching-oriented documentation as primary knowledge format

## System Architecture

### Layer 1: Storage Foundation (Git + Markdown)
