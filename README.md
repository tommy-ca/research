## PKM Workflow

1. **Capture**: All information starts in `vault/00-inbox/`
2. **Process**: Content is organized using PARA method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
3. **Connect**: Create atomic notes in `vault/permanent/` with bidirectional links
4. **Create**: Generate insights and synthesis in organized vault structure
5. **Review**: Regular processing and maintenance of knowledge system

## Getting Started
