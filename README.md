## Research Workflow

1. **Planning**: Document research objectives in `docs/research/`
2. **Experimentation**: Conduct experiments in `experiments/`
3. **Analysis**: Use notebooks for data analysis and visualization
4. **Documentation**: Record findings and methodologies in `docs/`
5. **Knowledge Capture**: Store insights in `knowledge-base/`

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the relevant section based on your research needs
3. Follow the README files in each directory for specific guidance
4. Use the established templates for consistent documentation

## Contributing
